1,1978,1H NMR of valine tRNA modified bases. Evidence for multiple conformations.,"Methyl and methylene protons of dihydrouridine 17 (hU), 6-methyladenosine 37 (M6A), 7-methylguanosine 46 (m7G), and ribothymidine 54 (rT) give clearly resolved peaks (220 MHz) for tRNA1val (coli solutions in D2O, 0.25 m NaCl, at 27 degrees C. Chemical shifts are generally consistent with a solution structure of tRNA1val similar to the crystal structure of tRNAphe (yeast). At least 3 separate transitions are observed as the temperature is raised. The earliest involves disruption of native tertiary structure and formation of intermediate structures in the m7G and rT regions. A second transition results in a change in structure of the anticodon loop, containing m6A. The final step involves unfolding of the m7G and rT intermediates and melting of the TpsiC helix. Low salt concentrations produce multiple, partially denatured conformations, rather than a unique form, for tRNA1val. Native structure is almost completely reformed by addition of Na+ but Mg2+ is required for correct conformation in the vicinity of m7G."
2,1978,2'-Deoxy-2'-fluorouridine-5'-phosphate: an alternative substrate for thymidylate synthetase from Escherichia coli K12.,"The substrate specificity of 2'-deoxy-2'-substituted uridines and their 5'-phosphates towards thymidylate synthetase from Escherichia coli K12 was investigated. Besides the natural substrate 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (dUMP), only 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine-5'-phosphate (dUflMP) was a substrate. The KM of dUflMP is 11 times higher than that of dUMP, while the Vmax values are virtually the same. It is concluded that the size of the 2'-substituent and not its polarity (and the concomitant conformational change) determines substrate specificity of thymidylate synthetase."
3,1978,360 MHz PMR studies on the involvement of the Y-nucleoside in the conformation of 2'-OMeGpApApYpAppsi from torula yeast tRNAphe.,"360 MHz measurements of chemical shifts, 3J1'-2', and T1 as a function of temperature for various protons of the hexanucleotide 2'-OMeGpApApYpAppsi from torula yeast tRNAphe have revealed a unique involvement of the Yt base in the structure and conformation of this oligonucleotide. Whereas the adenosine residues in the anticodon triplet are relatively stable to temperature increase, the Yt readily undergoes destacking and a change in ribose conformation. The destacking most likely involves a torsional displacement of the Yt base occasioned by a rotation of the phosphate-ribose backbone. The possible relevance of this unusual behavior to the influence of the Yt residue in tRNA function in protein biosynthesis is discussed."
4,1978,3'End labelling of RNA with 32P suitable for rapid gel sequencing.,"A new general method of labelling the 2',3'-diol end of RNA with 32P has been devised suitable for gel sequencing. Poly(A) polymerase (E. coli) is incubated with the RNA and limiting amounts of alpha-32P-ATP. The mono-addition product is then cleaved with periodate and beta-eliminated with aniline, leaving the RNA terminally labelled with 3' 32P-phosphate. When applied to a model compound, tRNAPhe from E. coli, over 28 residues could be read from the 3' end.Images"
5,1978,"5'-Halogeno-2',3'-cyclic sulphite isomers in the preparation of 5'-halogeno nucleosides. Synthesis of 5'-deoxyuridine and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine.","When uridine (Ia) is reacted with thionyl chloride in hexamethylphosphoric triamide a mixture of isomeric 5'-chloro-2',3'-sulphites is formed, which can be separated to individual epimers IIa and IIIa, in 45% and 15% yields, respectively. Analogously, crystalline epimers IIb (37%) and IIIb (17%) can be obtained from 5-fluorouridine (Ib). Both isomers IIa, IIIa (or IIb, IIIb) afford a single 5'-chloro derivative IVa (or IVb, respectively) if treated with 0.1N sodium methoxide. From the mixture of sulphites IIa and IIIa (or IIb and IIIb) crystalline 5'-chlorouridine IVa is formed in 84.5% yield, calculated per starting uridine Ia (or crystalline 5'-chloro-5-fluorouridine IVb, 85.5% per starting 5-fluorouridine Ib, respectively). On reduction of 5'-chlorouridine IVa with tributyltin hydride 5'-deoxyuridine (Va) is formed in 79% yield. During the reduction of 5'-chloro-5-fluoro derivative IVb to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (Vb, 57%) a partial reductive elimination of 5-fluorine takes place under formation of 5'-deoxyuridine (Va, 9%)."
6,1978,A 1:2 crystalline complex of ApA:proflavine: a model for binding to single-stranded regions in RNA.,"The structure of a 1""2 complex of adenylyl-(3',5')-adenosine phosphate and proflavine hemisulfate has been determined using the methods of x-ray crystallography. Since the ApA does not form a mini double helix, it may serve as a model for the interaction of planar molecules with single stranded nucleic acids. The dinucleotide adopts an extended conformation with the adenines in adjacent molecules forming base pairs. A most unusual feature of the molecule is that it does not obey the ""rigid nucleotide"" concept although none of the torsion angles occur in energetically unfavourable regions. This is most probably due to the strong interactions between the proflavine and the oligonucleotide."

8,1978,Ability of modified forms of phenylalanine tRNA to stimulate guanosine pentaphosphate synthesis by the stringent factor-ribosome complex of E. coli,"tRNAPhe of E. coli, modified at its 4-thiouridine (4Srd) and 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine (nbt3Urd) residues, was tested for its ability to induce (p)ppGpp synthesis. The 4Srd residue was derivatized with the p-azido-phenacyl group, cross-linked to Cyd13, and the borohydride reduction product of the cross-link was prepared. The nbt3Urd residue was derivatized with the N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)glycyl group. None of these derivatives had more than a minor effect on the affinity of the tRNA for the stringent factor-ribosome complex, and no effect at all on the maximum velocity of (p)ppGpp synthesis, either at 2 or 82 mM NH4Cl. These two regions of the tRNA which are on opposite faces of the tRNA molecule do not appear to be structurally important for recognition by the stringent factor-ribosome complex. They may provide useful sites, therefore, for the introduction of photoaffinity or fluorescent probes with which to study tRNA-stringent factor recognition."
9,1978,Absence of plant uptake and translocation of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs).,"Studies of polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) uptake by plants have been conducted in hydroponic solutions and in greenhouse experiments with soil. Autoradiograms of corn and soybean seedlings grown in hydroponic solutions showed no translocation of 14C-PBB from 14C-PBB-treated solutions to plant tops or within the leaf from 14C-PBB-treated spots on the upper leaf surface. A significant portion of the 14C-PBB associated with the roots was removed when the roots were dipped in acetone. Three root crops (radishes, carrots, and onions) were grown in two soils, each treated with a mixture of FireMaster BP-6 (PBB) and 14C-PBB to achieve final concentrations of 100 ppm and 100 ppb. All roots showed more PBB when grown in the soil with the lower clay and organic matter content than they did when grown in the soil with more clay and organic matter. In the latter soil (clay loam) no PBB was detected in any roots from the 100 ppb treatment. More PBB was associated with roots of carrot than of radish or onion. Corn leaf whorls containing dust from a PBB contamination soil and washed radishes from a heavily contaminated garden showed no PBB.ImagesFIGURE 1.FIGURE 2.FIGURE 3.FIGURE 4."

11,1978,A cell-free system for the replication fo bacteriophage M-13 duplex DNA.,"Cell-free extracts from M-13 am5 infected Escherichia coli cells which are highly concentrated on cellophane membrane disks replicate efficiently endogenous M-13 duplex DNA. If the reaction is carried out in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate, the majority of the label is found in two classes of hybrid DNA molecules in which either the viral or the complementary strand is newly synthesized. A minor portion of the label is incorporated into fully synthetic duplex DNA. DNA synthesis requires ATP and is inhibited by nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and arabinosylnucleoside triphosphates. Rifampicin blocks preferentially the synthesis of molecules with labeled complementary strands. A similar effect is observed upon addition of the helix-destabilising M-13 gene V protein. In contrast, addition of E. coli helix-destabilising protein (Eco HD-protein) stimulates the synthesis of both types of hybrid DNA molecules as well as the formation of fully synthetic duplex DNA."
12,1978,A characterization of mRNA activites and their sequence complexities in Trypanosoma brucei: partial purification and properties of the VSSA mRNA.,"Polyadenylated RNA isolated from a clone of Trypanosoma brucei was shown to direct the synthesis of a variety of polypeptides in a cell-free system. A predominant 58,000 dalton polypeptide was immunoprecipitated with antisera to the T. brucei variant specific surface antigen (VSSA). The mRNA that directed the synthesis of the VSSA was 2.0 kilobases (kb) long as measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 98% formamide. Complementary DNA was prepared with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and the nucleotide sequence complexities of the total polysomal poly(A)+RNA and a gel purified VSSA mRNA were measured. 20% of the total cellular poly(A)+RNA contained abundant sequences with an apparent complexity of 9.6 kb; 42% of the purified VSSA mRNA contained abundant sequences with a complexity of 7.2 kb. Complementary DNA synthesized from gel purified VSSA mRNA was hybridized to total cellular poly(A)+RNA isolated from an unrelated T. brucei clone expressing a different variant antigen. A portion of the low complexity RNA sequence component was absent in the heterologous mRNA population but the same plateau of hybridization was achieved (93%). The abundance of some of the low complexity mRNAs appears to be T. brucei clone specific.Images"
13,1978,A comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of synthetic DNA sequences of the homopurine . homopyrimidine and mixed purine- pyrimidine types.,"We have obtained the ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of two repeating trinucleotide DNAs, poly [d(A-G-G).d(C-C-T)] and poly[d(A-A-G).d(C-T-T)], that have all purines on one strand and all pyrimidines on the other. These spectra, together with spectra of other synthetic polymers, can be combined to give 3 first-neighbor calculations of the spectrum of poly[d(A).d(T)] and 2 first-neighbor calculations of the spectrum of poly [d(G).d(C)]. The results show (1) that first-neighbor calculations utilizing only spectra of homopurine.homopyrimidine DNA sequences are no more accurate than are similar calculations that involve spectra of mixed purine-pyrimidine sequences, demonstrating that double-stranded homopurine.homopyrimidine sequences do not obviously belong to a special class of secondary conformations, and (2) that the wavelength region above 250 nm in the CD spectra of synthetic DNAs is least predictable from first-neighbor equations, probably because this region is especially sensitive to sequence-dependent conformational differences."
14,1978,A computer aided oligonucleotide analysis provides a model sequence for RNA polymerase-promoter recognition in E.coli.,"A novel computer procedure has been used to search for homology among 17 known procaryotic promoter sequences. A model sequence, :formula: (see text), is compatible with the properties of all known promoter and operator mutations, predicts base positions for the initiation of RNA synthesis coinciding with those determined experimentally, is compatible with current models for the regulation of transcription, suggests that RNA polymerase could recognize the DNA double helix firstly in the B conformation then in the A."
15,1978,A computer assisted method for the determination of restriction enzyme recognifion sites.,"A computer program has been developed which aids in the determination of restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This is achieved by cleaving DNAs of known sequence with a restriction endonuclease and comparing the fragmentation pattern with a computer-generated set of patterns. The feasibility of this approach has been tested using fragmentation patterns of 0X174 DNA produced by enzymes of both known and unknown specificity. Recognition sequences are predicted for two restriction endonucleases (BbvI and SfaNI) using this method. In addition, recognition sequences are predicted for two other new enzymes (PvuI and MstI) using another computer-assisted method.Images"
16,1978,A conserved and unique (AT)-rich segment in yeast mitochondrial DNA.,The mtDNA of the cytoplasmic petite mutant of yeast RD1A consists mainly of a perfect head-to-tail repetition of a known sequence of 66 consecutive AT and 2 GC base pairs. We have hybridized complementary RNA made on RD1A mtDNA with the mtDNAs of four different wild-type Saccharomyces strains that differ markedly in restriction fragmentation pattern. The tm's of the four heteroduplexes are identical to the tm of the homoduplex of RD1A mtDNA with complementary RNA of one repeat length. With all four wild-type mtDNAs this complementary RNA hybridizes mainly to a single restriction fragment of about 300 base pairs. This shows the conservation and individuality of at least one (AT)-rich segment in yeast mtDNA. The 300 base pair fragment has been mapped in the vicinity of the oxi-2 locus. The possible role of the (AT)-rich segment in the processing of the primary transcript of this region is discussed.Images
17,1978,Activation and inactivation of neocarzinostatin-induced cleavage of DNA.,"The possible role of free radicals in the mechanism of neocarzinostatin (NCS) action was studied. While mercaptene markedly stimulate the ability of NCS to degrade DNA, they also rapidly inactivate the antibiotic in a preincubation and at higher concentration inhibit the degradation reaction. The radiation protector S,2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide-HBr is the most potent compound tested. Scavengers of diffusible OH radicals, O2- or H2O2 do not result in significant inhibition of the oxygen-dependent cleavage of DNA by NCS; in fact, alcohols and other organic solvents stimulate the reaction several-fold. By contrast, the potent peroxyl free radical scavenger, alpha-tocopherol, blocks the reaction 50% at 50 micron."
18,1978,Activation of chemicals into mutagens by green plants: a preliminary discussion.,"This paper is a review of recent studies that demonstrate the activation of chemicals (especially pesticides into mutagens by green plants. Such activation of pesticides may be hazardous to the public health because of their widespread use in agriculture and the current lack of information that exists about such processes. The mutagenic properties of the s-triazine herbicides (atrazine, simazine, and cyanazine) as exhibited in various assay systems are discussed. In vivo, in vitro, and in situ plant assays are presented, and the maize wx locus assay is discussed."
19,1978,Active DNA transcription sites released from the genome of normal embryonic chicken cells.,"Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) isolated from (and amounting to 1.5-2% of) native nuclear DNA of cultured embryonic chicken cells labelled 1-2 days with 3H-thymidine was analyzed by self-hybridization, hydroxyapatite chromatography (HAC) partial digestion with S1 nuclease, isopycnic centrifugation. Two main fractions were rehybridized to excess amounts of bulk nuclear DNA or total cytoplasmic RNAs. The major fraction, equivalent to 75% of total ssDNA, consists of unique DNA sequences, apparently derived from multiple coding regions of the cell genome, since they are not self-reassociating but are hybridizable to the non repetitious portion of bulk nuclear DNA and 40-45% of them are complementary to cell RNAs. About half of these ssDNA sequences hybridizable to cell RNAs seem to be closely connected with molecules belonging to the minor ssDNA fraction. The latter fraction consists of self-reassociating, moderately repeated DNA sequences, mainly derived from non coding regions of the cell genome. These findings are discussed in the light of others, showing interspersion of coding and non coding DNA sequences and susceptibility of active genes to certain nucleasic attacks."
20,1978,Affinity adsorbents consisting of nucleic acids immobilized via bisoxirane activated polysaccharides.,"An easy and efficient procedure for the immobilization of polynucleotide ligands to bisoxirane activated insoluble polysaccharides has been elaborated and is described in this paper. The resulting materials have been applied to the chromatography of DNA polymerase I, and RNA polymerase from E.coli. Because of their extraordinary stability to temperature, formamide, and alkaline conditions they seem to be particularly useful adsorbents for nucleic acid hybridization."
21,1978,"'A' forms of RNAs in single strands, duplexes and RNA-DNA hybrids.","Helical parameters have been calculated for the 'A' form minimum energy conformations of ApA, CpC, GpG, UpU, GpC and UpA. The helix geometries are base sequence dependent. The single strands are narrower and more tightly wound than that duplex RNA-11 form. 9-12 kcal./mole are needed to convert these single strands to the RNA-11 conformation. However, in some sequences other 'A' type conformers capable of complementary base pairing may be formed at lower energetic cost. There is substantially more base stacking in the calculated single strands than in the RNA-11 conformation. Calculated intrastrand base stacking energies reflect these differences, and also are sequence dependent. The 'A' form RNA subunits differ from the analogous DNAs in possessing a larger rise per residue, needed to accomodate the 2'-OH. RNA-DNA hybrids are consequently more likely to be in the 'A-RNA than in the 'A'-DNA conformation, although the base sequence determines the extent of the preference."

24,1978,Alteration in nucleosome structure induced by thermal denaturation.,"Mononucleosomes prepared from goose erythrocyte nuclei exhibited limited heterogeneity with respect to number of electrophoretic components, histones and DNA composition. The components differ slightly in ionic strength induced self-association. Thermal denaturation of each component gave only two dominant, highly cooperative, melting transitions, T"" and T""'. Urea and trypsin were used to establish the differential lability of these two transitions. Comparison of the morphologies of the mononucleosomes at various stages throughout the melting profile indicated that the 13.3 +/- 1.5 nm diameter mononucleosomes start to disrupt only in the latter half of transition T"" and do not unfold until after reaching T""'. The resultant, open ended (17.4 +/- 2.2 nm diameter) toroids are still largely negatively staining and much more uniform in shape if fixed simultaneously with gluteraldehyde.Images"
25,1978,Alterations in chromatin of cells infected with RNA tumor viruses.,"Chromatins were isolated from murine leukemia or sarcoma virus infected lymphocyte-like TB cells and compared by immunological and biochemical methods. Chromatin from virus infected cells did not fix complement as well as uninfected cell chromatin suggesting that conformational changes had occurred in chromatin from virus infected cells. This alteration was detected within 24 hours after infection. Infected cell chromatins, examined by electrophoretic methods after radiolabeling displayed alterations in nonhistone proteins, whereas the histones appeared unaltered. The non-histones were synthesized in greater amounts in infected compared to normal cells, particularly a 60,000 D protein, while the amount of histone did not vary. The above changes should not have been due to cell growth or cycle variations, for the cells had similar growth rates and were harvested from the same stage of cell confluency during exponential growth to ensure uniformity of culture conditions.Images"
26,1978,Alterations in lysine transfer RNA during erythroid differentiation of the Friend cell.,"The proportion of lysine tRNA represented by the isoacceptor species lysine tRNA4 has previously been shown to be largest in cells with the greatest ability to proliferate. Using reverse phase chromatography (RPC-5), we have analyzed the changes in the relative quantities of lysine tRNA species which occur in different cellular states of the Friend cell, a transformed murine cell infected with Friend erythroleukemia virus complex. This cell undergoes erythroid differentiation when exposed to various chemicals. Lysine tRNA4 comprises 32% of the total lysine tRNA in rapidly dividing, uninduced Friend cells, but only 16% of the total lysine tRNA in uninducase. Friend cells undergoing erythroid differentiation divide more slowly than uninduced cells, and finally cease proliferation, but lysine tRNA4 becomes the major lysine tRNA species (greater than 50%). This does not appear to reflect erythroid properties of the cell, since the lysine tRNA of the mouse reticulocyte contains very little lysine tRNA4. The non-dividing erythroid Friend cell, therefore, represents an exception to the finding that non-dividing cells usually have little or no lysine tRNA4 present."
27,1978,A method for sequencing restriction fragments with dideoxynucleoside triphosphates.,"A rapid enzymatic approach is described for the sequence analysis of a 5' terminally labelled restriction fragment. It involves limited nicking of the strands of the molecule throughout the sequence by pancreatic DNAase I. The 3' hydroxyl groups exposed by each nick are then used to prime chain extension by DNA polymerase I in four separate reactions. Each reaction uses one of the four chain terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNT-PSs), together with the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). In a single reaction all the 3' ends are terminated in positions of the same base, which is different for each of the four reactions. When the products of these reactions are resolved by gel electrophoresis according to size, a sequence can be deduced from the pattern of radioactive bands. Sequences can be determined onwards from 10-20 residues from the 5' labelled end. The length of sequence which can be determined is only limited by the resolution of the gel.Images"
28,1978,A method for the recovery of DNA from agarose gels.,"We describe a quick and versatile method for the isolation of DNA from agarose gels. The DNA is electrophoresed into a trough containing hydroxyapatite, where it is bound. The hydroxyapatite is taken out and the DNA eluted with phosphate buffer. By putting the hydroxyapatite on a small column of Sephadex G50, elution and subsequent removal of phosphate can be performed in one step. The DNA recovered can be used equally well in enzymatic incubations as DNA not purified through agarose gel electrophoresis. Several applications of this technique are described.Images"
29,1978,A model for the single stranded random coil form of polydeoxyadenylic acid from minimum energy conformations of the dimeric subunit.,"The minimum energy conformations of dApdA have been examined for their suitability as buildings blocks of the single stranded coil form of polynucleotides. Calculations of the characteristic ratio C difference = less than ro greater than 2/n liter2 were made for a polymer generated from all the low energy conformers, as well as for selected combinations. A polymer composed of a conformer with omega', omega = t*,g+,(skewed) psi = t, C-(2)-endo type pucker, in combination with the 'B' form, has a C difference equal to that observed in coils of apurinic acid (6) when the fraction of 'B' form conformers is approximately 25% and approximately 91%. The t*,g+ conformer is the second lowest energy form in the C-(2)-endo puckering domain, following the 'B' form."
30,1978,Analysis of terminal structures of RNA from potato virus X.,"The 5'-end structure of potato virus X RNA was determined following enzymatic methylation in vitro. A single 3H-methyl group was introduced into the 2'-position of the 5'-penultimate residue and the end structure was determined as m7GpppG(m)pAp(Xp)3G. This part of the RNA apparently is involved in binding to ribosomes since it can be partially protected against RNase digestion by wheat germ 40S ribosomes. PVX RNA was not retained by poly(U)-sepharose, indicating that it does not contain a 3'-terminal poly(A) tract."
31,1978,Analysis of the 3'-terminal nucleotide sequence of vesicular stomatitis virus N protein mRNA.,"The sequence of 205 nucleotides adjacent to the poly(A) tract at the 3'-terminus of the mRNA encoding the N polypeptide of vesicular stomatitis virus has been determined by copying with reverse transcriptase and using 2', 3'-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates as specific chain terminators. The method appears highly suitable for sequence determination in any purified mRNA. An examination of the sequence did not locate without ambiguity the limit of polypeptide coding RNA. The hexanucleotide AAUAAA, previously found in all poly(A)-containing eukaryote mRNAs, is not present, although the sequence immediately adjacent to the 3'-terminal poly(A) has a high content of A+U.Images"
32,1978,Analysis of the genome of type 7 simian adenovirus using restrictases.,"The effect of the restricting endonucleases R.EcoRI, R.BamI and R.SalI on the genome of type 7 simian adenovirus (SA-7) has been studied. Since the DNA has only one site of R.EcoRI recognition the enzyme cleaves SA-7 DNA into two fragments with the molecular weights 12.0 and 10.0 . 10(6). The restrictase R.BamI cleaves the SA-7 DNA at six sites producing 7 fragments with the molecular weights 6.6, 5.9, 3.8, 2.7, 1.3, 0.7 and 0.6 . 10(6). R.SalI cleavage yields 6 fragments with the molecular weights 8.1, 5.5, 4.3, 2.45, 1.2 and 0.6 . 10(6). The R.BamI and R.SalI fragments are arranged in the orders E-A-D-F-C-G-B and A-B-D-F-E-C, respectively. The only R.EcoRI recognition site is localized in the C fragment produced by R.BamI and in the B fragment produced by R.SalI.Images"
33,1978,Analysis of the steady-state mechanism of the aminoacylation of tRNAPhe by phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase from yeast.,"The steady-state mechanism of the aminoacylation of tRNAPhe by the corresponding synthetase from yeast has been investigated in detail by kinetic experiments. It was found that there are two alternative mechanisms: one favoured at low tRNA concentrations and the other at high tRNA concentrations. ATP and Phe are bound randomly to the enzyme. AMP is released immediately after the binding of ATP and Phe. Between the release of AMP and pyrophosphate (PPi) there is at least one additional step. Based on the experimental results a model of the steady-state mechanism is proposed. This model includes the sequence of addition of substrates to the enzyme and the release of products from the enzyme as well as the composition of the intermediate complexes with the enzyme. This model is in accordance with previous results based on different techniques. The results are explained by a ""flip-flop"" mechanism for all the substrates and products involved in the reaction."

35,1978,An efficient in vitro total reconstitution of the Escherichia coli 50S ribosomal subunit,"A new, relatively simple technique for the total invitro reconstitution of E. coli 50S ribosomes has been developed. It is a two-step procedure like that previously reported by Nierhaus and Dohme [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 71, 4713 (1974)], but it differs in a number of important aspects. Ribosomal RNA is prepared by direct phenol extraction of 70S particles to minimize nuclease fragmentation. A mixture of 50S proteins is prepared by acetic acid extraction and immediate removal of the acetic acid by thin film dialysis. The resulting protein mixture is soluble and stable. Separate RNA and protein fractions are mixed, incubated first at 44å¡C in 7.5 mM Mg2+, and then at 50å¡C in 20 mM Mg2+. The resulting 50S particles comigrate with native 50S particles in analytical gradients. They range from 50 to 100% active in five different functional assays. This is a fairly stringent test of the effectiveness of reconstitution since 50S particles derived from highly active vacant couples were used as a control.Images"
36,1978,An electron microscope study of the proteins attached to polio virus RNA and its replicative form (RF).,"A recently described method (Wu, M. and Davidson, N. (1978), Nucleic Acids Research 5, in press) for visualizing proteins attached to nucleic acids in the electron microscope has been applied to study proteins attached to poliovirion RNA and to the viral double-stranded intracellular RF form. A protein is found at the 5' end of the plus strand virion RNA, and protein components are found at both ends of the duplex RF. In the RF as usually extracted, there is frequently a larger or compound protein aggregate at the end which contains the 3' end of the plus strand and the 5' end of the minus strand. Banding in CsCl-guanidinium hydrochloride in the presence of sarkosyl causes dissociation of some components of this aggregate, leaving both ends labeled with the covalently bound VPg. These results confirm and extend previous biochemical studies of proteins bound to poliovirion RNA and to the RF form.Images"
37,1978,An electron microscopic method for the mapping of proteins attached to nucleic acids.,"An electron microscopic method for demonstrating the presence of and mapping the positions of proteins specifically bound to nucleic acids is described. The nucleic acid-protein complex is treated with dinitrofluorobenzene under conditions such that dinitrophenyl (DNP) groups are attached to nucleophilic groups on the protein, with only a low level of random attachment to the nuclei acid. This product is treated with rabbit anti-DNP IgG. The position of the protein-(DNP)n(IgG)m complex on the nucleic acid strand can be observed by electron microscopy by protein free spreading methods and, in many cases, by cytochrome-c spreading. If necessary for visualization by the latter method, the size of the labeled region can be increased by treatment with goat anti-rabbit IgG. High efficiency of electron microscopic labeling is achieved. Examples studied are: the adenovirus-2 DNA terminal protein, a protein covalently bound to SV40 DNA, DNA polymerase I bound to DNA, E. coli RNA polymerase bound to T7 DNA, and proteins UV crosslinked to avian sarcoma virus RNA.Images"
38,1978,An Escherichia coli ribonuclease which removes an extra nucleotide from a biosynthetic intermediate of bacteriophage T4 proline transfer RNA.,"The biosynthesis of bacteriophage T4 tRNAPro, tRNASer, and tRNAIle requires enzymatic removal of extra nucleotides from the 3' terminus of the respective precursor RNAs. A ribonuclease activity capable of catalyzing such reactions has been partially purified from uninfected Escherichia coli using an artificial precursor RNA as substrate. A number of ribonuclease activities were resolved during purification. Use of E. coli strain BN, a mutant known to be deficient in the relevant ribonuclease activity, permitted us to identify it in wild-type cells. This activity was designated the BN ribonuclease. BN ribonuclease had an apparent molecular weight of 35,000 as measured by Sephadex gel filtration. Mg2+ was required for activity, which was optimal at [Mg2+] of 2mM. Activity did not require monovalent cations K+ or Na+. BN ribonuclease was less efficient at removing extra residues in the biosynthesis of tRNASer and tRNAIle than in the biosynthesis of tRNAPro.Images"

40,1978,A new method for the purification and identification of covalently closed circular DNA molcules.,"A new technique has been developed for the rapid isolation of covalently closed circular DNA molecules. The procedure is a selective extraction based on differences in the partitioning of covalently closed circular DNA molecules and noncovalently closed species between phenol and water at acid pH and low ionic strength. Under the conditions described, linear as well as nicked circular DNA is extracted into phenol, while covalently closed circular DNA molecules remain in the water phase. The method permits the quantitative isolation of covalently closed circular DNA from either total cellular DNA or partially purified preparations, to a degree of purity comparable with buoyant density procedures.Images"
41,1978,A new RNA-RNA crosslinking reagent and its application to ribosomal 5S RNA.,"The synthesis of a new RNA specific bifunctional crosslinking reagent, 1.4-phenyl-diglyoxal, is described which reacts exclusively with guanosines. The properties of the crosslinked products enabled us to develop a straightforward method for identifying the reacted nucleotides. Results obtained with ribosomal 5S RNA of Escherichia coli demonstrate the formation of an intramolecular crosslink between guanosine-2 and guanosine-112 in the stem region.Images"

45,1978,A novel conformational change of the anticodon region of tRNAPhe (yeast).,"The temperature dependence of the fluorescence of the Y-base of tRNAPhe (yeast) was investigated kinetically by the temperature jump method. In the range between -15 degrees C and +30 degrees C A NOVEL CONFORMATIONAL TRANSITION OF THE TRNA could be characterized. This conformational change was found in the absence of any artificial label; it is a characteristic property of tRNAPhe in its native structure. This transition accounts for 30% of the total fluorescence change. Its activation enthalpy is 16 kcal/mole (67 kJ/mole), and the transition enthalpy is between -2 kcal/mole and +2 kcal/mole (+/-8 kJ/mole). A model is represented in which this transition can be explained by a a change in the stacking pattern of the anticodon loop. The experimental findings are discussed with respect to several hypotheses about the molecular mechanism of protein biosynthesis which postulate conformational rearrangements of the anticodon loop."
46,1978,Antibodies distinguishing between intact and alkali-hydrolyzed 7-methylguanosine,"Antibodies specific for intact 7-methylguanosine (m7G) were induced in rabbits and mice by immunization with nucleoside-BSA or nucleoside-hemocyanin conjugates. Since m7G undergoes alkali-catalyzed hydrolytic fission of the purine ring, modifications were made in the procedure for conjugation of m7G to proteins. After periodate oxidation, m7G was incubated with protein at pH 9.1 at 4å¡C for one hour during which the nucleoside was found to be stable. Reduction of the Schiff base was done with t-butylamine borane for 30 minutes, and the conjugated protein was isolated quickly by gel filtration at pH 7.2. Both rabbits and mice produced antibodies that readily distinguished between the intact and hydrolyzed m7G. Antibody specificity depended largely on the presence of an intact 7-substituted imidazole ring and some cross-reaction occurred with 7-methylinosine. A weaker reaction occurred with ribothymidine and thymidine. Mouse antibodies induced by m7G-hemocyanin showed the highest specificity. They also recognized m7G in the isolated mRNA cap structure m7G(5‰Û_)ppp(5‰Û_)A."
47,1978,Antibodies elicited by defined oligodeoxyribonucleotide sequences.,"Antibodies to the oligodeoxyribonucleotides d(pT)3, d(pT)4, d(pT)6 and d(pA-A-T-T) were elicited in rabbits by immunization with electrostatic complexes of the respective haptens with methylated bovine serum albumin (MBSA). The antisera were assayed by complement fixation using denatured DNA's of various sources as antigens. The specificities of the antibodies were determined by estimating the inhibition of the complement fixation reaction by defined oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The antibodies were shown to be specific for the sequence of the oligode-oxyribonucleotides or parts of it."
48,1978,"Antibodies to N6-(delta2-isopentenyl) adenosine and its nucleotide: interaction with purified tRNAs and with bases, nucleosides and nucleotides of the isopentenyladenosine family.","The interaction of antibodies directed toward N6-(delta2-isopentenyl)adenosine, i6Ado, or its nucleotide with related bases, nucleosides, nucleotides and purified tRNAs is described. The selectivity of the antibody preparation was tested in inhibition experiments utilizing a sensitive radioimmunoassay to quantitate the binding of [3H]i6Ado to the antibody. Purified tRNAs containing various modified nucleosides adjacent to the 3'-end of the anticodon were tested to provide information about the selectivity of the antibody preparation toward nucleotides in this position of the tRNA chain. Antibodies directed against the nucleotide hapten were used to purify tRNAs which contain i6Ado and to quantitate the amount of that nucleotide. The same order of selectivity was expressed whether the nucleotides were free or in a tRNA molecule. Interaction of the antibody with compounds from the i6Ado family demonstrated dominance of the hydrophobic isopentenyl group and the importance of positional differences of modifications."
49,1978,A nuclear protein-modifying enzyme is responsive to ordered chromatin structure.,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, a nuclear protein-modifying enzyme, binds to the internucleosomal linker region of chromatin, although it modifies certain core nucleosomal histones in addition to histone H1. The activity per unit of DNA chromatin changes with the nucleosome repeat number. It reaches a maximum on chromatin of 8-10 nucleosomes in length. As the complexity of chromatin with respect to nucleosome repeat number and compactness increases, a decline and stabilization of specific activity is noted. The difference in specific activity is maintained through resedimentation and dialysis of particles. It does not appear due to differences in polymer chain length or differential degradation of poly (ADP-ribose). The data suggest a relationship between ADP-ribosylation and chromatin organization and vice versa.Images"
50,1978,A photoaffinity labelling study of the messenger RNA-binding region of Escherichia coli ribosomes.,"A photoaffinity labelling study of the messenger RNA-binding region of E. coli ribosomes has been made, using oligoadenylic acids as mRNA analogs. The oligonucleotides, of chain length 6 to 8 and thus several nucleotides longer than oligonucleotides previously employed for this purpose, carried a radioactive photolabile aromatic azide reagent bound covalently to the 3'-terminal ribose moiety. The synthesis of the reagent, p-azidobenzoyl-(3H)-glycylhydrazide, is described. The derivatized oligonucleotides were shown to be functional messengers. They stimulated the binding of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA, lysyl-tRNA: their binding was reciprocally stimulated by lysyl-tRNA; and they competed with underivatized oligoadenylates for ribosomal binding sites. When the 70 S ribosomal binding complex was irradiated, the photolabile reagent reacted covalently with both RNA and proteins of the 30 S subunit and with tRNA, but not with the 50 S subunit. The 16 S RNA appeared to be labelled at more than one site. Of the proteins, S3 and S5 reacted with the reagent with high specificity; and the possibility was not eliminated that S4 may have been labelled to a minor degree. Functional studies in other laboratories have implicated S3 and S5 in the decoding process, but these proteins were not labelled by any of the previously reported mRNA affinity labelling analogs. The results reported here therefore indicate that S3 and S5 not only affect the decoding process, but are located in the mRNA-binding region of the ribosome, presumably to the 3' side of the decoding site."
51,1979,1H NMR investigation of the conformational states of DNA in nucleosome core particles.,"In this study 1H NMR has been used to investigate the conformational state of DNA in nucleosome core particles. The nucleosome core particles exhibit partially resolved low field (10-15 ppm) spectra due to imino protons in Watson-Crick base pairs (one resonance per GC or AT base pair). To a first approximation, the spectrum is virtually identical with that of protein-free 140 base pair DNA, and from this observation we draw two important conclusions: (i) Since the low field spectra of DNA are known to be sensitive to conformation, the conformation of DNA in the core particles is essentially the same as that of free DNA (presumably B-form), (ii) since kinks occurring at a frequency at 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 base pairs would result in a core particle spectrum different from that of free DNA we find no NMR evidence supporting either the Crick-Klug or the Sobell models for kinking DNA around the core histones. Linewidth considerations indicate that the rotational correlation time for the core particles is approximately 1.5 X 10(-7) sec, whereas the end-over-end tumbling time of the free 140 base pair DNA is 3 X 10(-7) sec."
52,1979,1H NMR studies on the conformational characteristics of 2-thiopyrimidine nucleotides found in transfer RNAs.,"The molecular conformations of naturally occurring 2-thiopyrimidine nucleosides (5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine and 2-thiocytidine) and 5'-mononucleotides (5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine 5'-monophosphate and 2-thiocytidine 5'-monophosphate) in 2H2O solution were elucidated by analyses of the proton NMR spin-coupling constant, nuclear Overhauser effect, and lanthanide-induced shifts and relaxation enhancements. As monomers, these nucleotides are almost exclusively in the 3E-gg-anti form, even in the absence of ordinary stabilizing factors of this form; i. e., base-stacking and base-pairing interactions with other nucleotide units. This inherent conformational rigidity of the 2-thiopyrimidine units probably contributes to stability of the conformation of tRNA."
53,1979,2'-Deoxy-2'-fluorouridine-5'-triphosphates: a possible substrate for E. coli RNA polymerase.,dUflTP was tested as substrate in the E. coli RNA polymerase system using poly(dAT) as template. dUflTP could replace UTP when Mn++ was utilized as divalent cation instead of Mg++. The level of transcription with the fluoro analog was then 55% of that with UTP.
54,1979,31P NMR studies of the solution structure and dynamics of nucleosomes and DNA.,"31P NMR studies of 140 base pair DNA fragments in nucleosomes and free in solution show no detectable change in the internucleotide 31P chemical shift or linewidth when DNA is packaged into nucleosomes. Measurements of 31P spin-lattice relaxation times T1 and 31P-[H] nuclear Overhauser enhancements revealed internal motion with a correlation time of about 4 x 10(-10) sec in double helical DNA, both free in solution and bound to nucleosomal core proteins. This result implies greater dynamic mobility in double helical DNA than has previously been supposed."
55,1979,5' and 3' terminal nucleotide sequences of the RNA genome segments of influenza virus.,"EXtensive nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5' and the 3' terminal of the RNA segments of the genome of fowl plague virus, an avian strain of influenza virus, confirms the presence of a common sequence at the 5' terminus of each segment and a common sequence at the 3' terminus of each segment. Between the ends of each individual segment there is a complementary sequence which may be important in the control of transcription and replication of the genome. In addition, the probable sites of initiation of translation of fowl plague virus mRNA are indicated along with the corresponding NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the virus polypeptides.Images"
56,1979,8-Phosphorus substituted isosteres of purine and deazapurines.,"Synthesis of 8-phosphorus substituted isosteres of purine [pyrimidino (4,5-d)-1,3,2-diazaphosphole], 1-deazapurine [pyridino (2,3-d)-1,3,2-diazaphosphole] and 3-deazapurine [pyridino (4,5-d)-1,3,2-diazaphosphole] has been achieved by the reaction of equimolar amounts of triphenylphosphite and 4,5-diaminopyrimidine, 2,3-diaminopyridine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, respectively. These compounds hydrolyzed (cleavage of the phosphorus-nitrogen bounds) in aqueous solutions to provide the corresponding diaminopyrimidine or diaminopyridines. These three new basic ring systems constitute the first reported synthesis of purines in which ring carbon atom is substituted with a phosphorus atom. 8-Phosphorus substituted purine at a concentration of 4 X 10(-4)M caused a 50% inhibition in the growth of leukemia L1210 cells in culture. The biochemical rationale for the synthesis of these compounds is discussed."
57,1979,Absence of cytosine methylation at C-C-G-G and G-C-G-C sites in the rDNA coding regions and intervening sequences of Drosophila and the rDNA of other insects.,"Cytosine residues in C-G dinucleotides are frequently methylated in eukaryote DNA. In DNA of the dinoflagellate C. cohnii, the sequence C-MeC-G-G apparently renders Hpa II (C-C-G-G) incapable of digesting whole cell DNA in general, and rDNA in particular. Msp I, which also recognizes C-C-G-G but cleaves irrespective of methylation, degrades C. cohnii DNA and produces rDNA segments of 10.2 to 1.4 kb. We have applied this Hpa II/Msp I test to unfractionated DNA, and to rDNA and the rDNA intervening sequence of Drosophila virilis embryos and adults. There is no evidence of C-MeC-G-G sequences in either developmental stage of this species. Absence of G-MeC-G-C from coding and intervening sequences of rDNA was shown in comparisons of Hha I (G-C-G-C) cleavage patterns of unfractionated DNA and cloned (unmodified) segments of rDNA. Comparisons of Hpa II and Msp I cleavage products of DNA from the house fly, the flesh fly and a bumblebee also revealed no internal cytosine methylation in the sequence C-C-G-G. Because amounts of McC in C-G dinucleotides vary greatly among species, from apparent nonexistence to substantial proportions, no inference may yet be drawn about the role of such base modifications in DNA.Images"

63,1979,Acid mine drainage and subsidence: effects of increased coal utilization.,The increases above 1975 levels for acid mine drainage and subsidence for the years 1985 and 2000 based on projections of current mining trends and the National Energy Plan are presented. No increases are projected for acid mine drainage from surface mines or waste since enforcement under present laws should control this problem. The increase in acid mine drainage from underground mines is projected to be 16 percent by 1985 and 10 percent by 2000. The smaller increase in 2000 over 1985 reflects the impact of the PL 95-87 abandoned mine program. Mine subsidence is projected to increase by 34 and 115 percent respectively for 1985 and 2000. This estimate assumes that subsidence will parallel the rate of underground coal production and that no new subsidence control measures are adopted to mitigate subsidence occurrence.
64,1979,A comparative study of G+C-rich satellite components of sheep and goat DNA.,"Restriction fragment patterns of G+C-rich satellites of sheep and goat DNA were compared. The 1,712 g/cm3 satellites of both species appear homologous, consisting of repeats 760 base pairs long and showing coincidence of position of primary+ EcoRI, BamHI and most BspRI restriction target sites. The EcoRI and BamHI endonucleases produce mostly monomers of the repeating unit, while oligomers prevail in the A1uI and Bg1II digests. Species-specific differences in the frequency, position and mode of distribution of secondary+ restriction target sites for EcoRI, Bg1II and A1uI were observed. Unlike the 1,712 g/cm3 satellites, the 1,723 g/cm3 component of sheep DNA and the 1,719 g/cm3 material from goat DNA appear species--specific, since no homologous material could ever be detected in the DNA of the other species.Images"
65,1979,A convenient sequencing method for 5' protein-linked RNAs.,"A convenient nucleotide sequencing method for 5' end protein-linked RNAs was developed. Genome of LSc, 2ab poliovirus, which has a protein (VPg) covalently linked to the 5' terminus, was labelled with 125I Bolton and Hunter reagent after proteinase K treatment. No sign of labelling of nucleotide moiety in the genome with the reagent was detected. A labelled oligo peptide-linked ribonuclease T1 fragment was obtained from the 5' end of the genome. Analysis of the complex by two dimensional gel electrophoresis after partial alkali digestion or by the nucleotide sequencing method of Donis-Keller et al. (1) revealed that LSc, 2ab strain genome had an identical 5' end structure to that of Mahoney strain genome, that is, VPg-pUpUpApApApApCpApGp. Our results have shown that this labelling method is useful for analysis of 5' end sequence of RNAs linked to protein at the 5' termini.Images"
66,1979,A correlation between nucleosome spacer region susceptibility to DNase I and histone acetylation.,"Hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cell nuclei were digested with either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease and the nucleohistone digestion products fractionated by gel electrophoresis or exclusion chromatography. Under appropriate conditions, gel electrophoresis demonstrates that for both nucleases, only cleavages within the nucleosome spacer regions and not within the nucleosome core lead to freely migrating nucleohistone particles. These particles consist of nucleosome cores, nucleosomes and nucleosome oligomers. Following DNase I digestion and fractionation by exclusion chromatography, analysis of the histones indicates a direct relationship between increased spacer region susceptibility to nuclease and increased nucleosomal histone acetylation. Evidently digestion sites outside the regions of DNA protected by core histones can reflect the degree of acetylation of core histones. Such a relationship is not found when micrococcal nuclease is used to digest the samples.Images"
67,1979,Addition of oligonucleotides to the 5'-terminus of DNA by T4 RNA ligase.,Bacteriophage T4-induced RNA ligase catalyzes the controlled template-independent addition of RNA to the 5'-phosphoryl end of large DNA molecules. Restriction enzyme-generated fragments of Co1E1 DNA with completely basepaired or cohesive ends and linear single-stranded ÌüX174 viral DNA were all good substrates. DNA molecules from 10 to 6000 nucleotides long were quantitatively joined in an hour to a number of different RNA homopolymers. The most efficient of these was A(pA)5; I(pI)5 and C(pC)5 were also utilized while U(pU)5 was not. The optimum ribohomopolymer length was six nucleotides. Joining of ribohomopolymers between 10 and 20 nucleotides long occurred at approximately 1/2 the maximal rate and a trimer was the shortest substrate. Thus RNA ligase provides a method for generating extensions of predetermined length and base composition at the 5'-end of large DNA molecules that complements the available procedures for extending the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of DNA.Images
68,1979,"A DRB (5,6 dichloro-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole)-resistant adenovirus mRNA.","5,6-Dichloro-beta-D ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (DRB) inhibits transcription from the major late adenovirus promoter, located on the r-strand at map position 16.3 on the viral genome. 100-500 nucleotides long RNA chains with capped 5'-termini are transcribed from this promoter in the presence of 70 muM DRB. Synthesis of the mRNA for polypeptide IX which is unspliced and maps on the r-strand between positions 9.7 and 10.9 appears, however, to be DRB-resistant although it is transcribed by polymerase II and capped. Translatable mRNA for polypeptide IX is synthesized in the presence of DRB while the mRNAs for the other viral structural proteins are not synthesized. This differential DRB-inhibition of polymerase II transcription suggests either that short mRNAs may escape inhibition or that unspliced mRNAs are insensitive to the drug.Images"

70,1979,Age and sensitivity to lead toxicity: a review.,"During the past 20 years considerable attention has been focused on the epidemiologic features of childhood lead poisoning in the United States. Large numbers of children with symptomatic intoxication, as well as those with incipient symptoms, were commonplace a decade ago for physicians working in inner-city hospitals. With the recent availability of improved screening techniques, as well as a variety of environmental control measures, the incidence of symptomatic lead poisoning in children has diminished significantly in recent years. With the focus shifting from children with dangerously elevated body lead burdens to those with less significant exposures, increased attention has been directed to the various inherent metabolic and physical characteristics of the young that may influence the toxic effects of lead exposure. A number of differences with respect to lead exposure, absorption and retention, and varying nutritional conditions between children and older individuals are discussed. Experimental studies dealing with age differences of lead-treated animals are examined, and relevant human studies are reviewed."
71,1979,Age as a function in the development of sodium-related hypertension.,"The populations of the developed nations of the world exhibit an increase in blood pressure with age, while in primitive societies blood pressure remains relatively constant throughout adult life. Hypertension may be a complex of diseases all having the same clinical manifestations but not being caused necessarily by the same factors. A possible common denominator in the development of any chronic elevation of blood pressure is the need for the kidney to increase urine volume to promote sodium excretion and, thereby, prevent a chronically expanded extracellular fluid (ECF). Hypertension may be viewed as a maladaptation of the body in its attempt to maintain homeostasis of the ECF. Man evolved under conditions of relative scarcity of salt and even now can maintain normal body function with an intake of less than 2 g/day. The high risk person appears to have a hereditary predisposition to a rise in blood pressure in the presence of a high sodium (NaCl) intake. Actually, the degree of rise in blood pressure may be an interaction between the amount of genetic predisposition and the level of sodium and its relation to potassium intake. Recent work in two Massachusetts communities supports this interpretation and suggests that differences in blood pressure distribution may increase with age between a higher and lower sodium community."
72,1979,Alkaline deoxyribonucleases released from Neurospora crassa mycelia: two activities not released by mutants with multiple sensitivities to mutagens.,"Three major alkaline deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activities have been identified in sorbose-containing liquid culture medium in which wild-type Neurosporacrassa were grown: DNase A, a Ca++dependent endonuclease of molecular weight 65,000 daltons which has no specificity for single- or double-stranded DNA (ss-DNA or ds-DNA) and no activity with RNA; DNase B, a Mg++-dependent single-strand specific exonuclease of molecular weight 78,000 daltons active with both ss-DNA and RNA; DNase C, a divalent metal ion-dependent endo-exonuclease of molecular weight 65,000 having single-strand specific endonuclease activity with ss-DNA and RNA and exonuclease activity with ds-DNA. Three mutants which were shown previously to have wide spectra of sensitivities to mutagens, and which exhibited reduced release of DNase activity on sorbose-containing agar test plates (the Nuh phenotype), were deficient relative to the wild-type in the release of these major alkaline DNases into the liquid culture medium. The uvs-3 mutant released only small amounts of DNase A and DNase C; nuh-4 did not release detectable DNase C and released only a very low level of DNase B; uvs-6 released only a low level of DNase A. A nuh mutant (nuh-3) which is not mutagen sensitive relative to the wild-type released low levels of DNase B. On the other hand, an ultraviolet light-sensitive mutant (nuc-2) which does not have the Nuh phenotype was normal in the release of these DNases."
73,1979,Alkaline stability of guanosine and some of its derivatives modified by the carcinogen N-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene.,"The alkaline treatment of Guo, dGuo, dGMP and denatured DNA modified by N-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene (N-AcO-AAF) was performed in 0.1 M NaOH at 40 degrees C. The kinetics of the reaction were followed by ultraviolet absorption and by chromatographic methods and were found different for the four products under study. Circular dichroism spectra show differences in the environment of acetylaminofluorene residue in these products. The alkaline treatment of Guo-AAF (and dGuo-AAF) leads to the formation of three products. These products were separated by thin layer chromatography and by HPLC and were characterized by spectroscopic methods. One is the already known unstable Guo-AF (and respectively dGuo-AF) (1). The other two products are relatively stable products of the transformation of Guo-AF (or dGuo-AF). These last ones present almost identical ultraviolet absorption spectra, but very different circular dichroism spectra."
74,1979,alpha 1-Antitrypsin deficiency and susceptibility to lung disease.,"This subject concerns the complex interrelationship of a genetically determined protein deficiency, enzymes which are inhibited by that protein, environmental challenges such as cigarette smoke and industrial pollutants, and the occurrence of obstructive lung disease (Fig. 1). Unequivocal establishment of an etiological role for AAT deficiency, especially of intermediate degree, has proven to be difficult. Confounding variables such as enzyme concentration in PMN and PAMs, duration of exposure to potential environmental hazards, differences in laboratory methods utilized in measuring AAT and in studying pulmonary function all require investigation. The definitive study, incorporating all of these and other factors, has yet to be conducted. No single, clear-cut conclusion can be drawn from analysis of present studies. In those circumstances in which heterozygotes appear to be predisposed to COPD, phenotypic screening of the population at potential risk, such as industrial workers may be appropriate. Conversely, in conditions in which no association is demonstrated, such screening would not be justified. Perhaps, the best one can do is to suggest a ""Scotch verdict""; that is, the issue of causation is not proven."
75,1979,alpha 1-Fetoprotein mRNA of rat yolk sac and hepatoma.,"Rat alpha 1-fetoprotein mRNA was isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity by means of immunoadsorption and oligo (dT) cellulose affinity chromatography. Purified AFP mRNA migrated as a 21S peak in 2.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The translation product of this mRNA in micrococcal nuclease treated reticulocyte lysate was identified as AFP by specific immunoprecipitation, SDS-gel electrophoresis and tryptic digestion analysis. DNA complimentary to AFP mRNA was synthesized with avian meyloblastosis virus RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. This AFP cDNA was used as a probe to quantitate AFP mRNA in the developing rat liver and to compare the complexity and diversity of AFP mRNA derived from the normal rat liver and Morris hepatoma 7777. We found that the amount of functional AFP mRNA is decreasing during liver development. There is very little, if any, AFP mRNA in the adult rat liver. A high degree of homology between the AFP mRNA sequences of yolk sac and hepatoma was also found."
76,1979,A method for the enzymatic synthesis and purification of [alpha-32P] nucleoside triphosphates.,"A simplified method is described for the enzymatic synthesis and purification of [alpha-32P]ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The products are obtained at greater than 97% radiochemical purity with yields of 50--70% (relative to 32Pi) by a two-step elution from DEAE-Sephadex. All reactions are done in one vessel as there is no need for intermediate product purifications. This method is therefore suitable for the synthesis of these radioactive compounds on a relatively large scale. The sequential steps of the method involve first the synthesis of [gamma-32P]ATP and the subsequent phosphorylation of nucleoside 3' monophosphate with T4 polynucleotide kinase to yield nucleoside 3', [5'-32P]diphosphate. Hexokinase is used after the T4 reaction to remove any remaining [gamma-32P]ATP. Nucleoside 3',[5'-32P]diphosphate is treated with nuclease P-1 to produce the nucleoside [5'-32P]monophosphate which is phosphorylated to the [alpha-32P]nucleoside triphosphate with pyruvate kinase and nucleoside monophosphate kinase. Adenosine triphosphate used as the phosphate donor for [alpha-32P]deoxynucleoside triphosphate syntheses is readily removed in a second purification step involving affinity chromatography on boronate-polyacrylamide. [alpha-32P]Ribonucleoside triphosphates can be similarly purified when deoxyadenosine triphosphate is used as the phosphate donor.Images"
77,1979,A method of record linkage.,"In cancer epidemiology, prospective approaches are very important both in testing etiological hypotheses and in evaluating preventive procedures. Prospective studies, however, are very difficult and expensive, because a large number of people and a long period of observation are necessary for a satisfactory study. As a data source for follow-up studies, population-based cancer registry is very useful. The Osaka Cancer Registry has been in operation since December, 1962. Since 1968 the data processing, including the work of collation, has been semicomputerized. In order to identify cancer patients, we use the following six indices: date of birth, first Chinese character of a person's family name, address a: city, ward, town or village, address b: further details. i.e., street, avenue, section, hamlet etc., site, and sex. When we have data on the collation indices for the subjects to be followed up, we can conduct follow-up studies easily and accurately, using a semicomputerized collation method similar to that in the cancer registration system. Because the master file of the Osaka Cancer Registry contains the data of cancer cases reported and all cancer deaths among the residents of Osaka Prefecture, we can follow up the subjects living in Osaka Prefecture and obtain data about vitually all cancer incidences and deaths among them. In this follow-up method by means of record linkage to the cancer registry, some considerations should be taken into account for the following factors; coverage of cancer data in the Osaka Cancer Registry, reliability of the collation method, and address of the subjects to be followed up. As an example of a study with this method, we present the follow-up study of the screenees of a mass screening program for stomach cancer."

IVI Synthesis of the 3‰Û_-amino-3‰Û_-deoxynucleoside 5‰Û_-phosphates,"A new procedure has been developed for the synthesis of 3‰Û_-amino-3‰Û_-deoxyribonucleosides of adenine, cytosine and uracil by condensing the trimethylsilylated bases with peracylated 3-azido-3-deoxyribose derivative. The azido group could subsequently be reduced to amino. The 5‰Û_-phosphates of these nucleosides have been prepared and the analogues have been tested for their ability to stimulate the ribosome-catalyzed reaction of 3‰Û_(2‰Û_)-O-(N-formylmethionyl)adenosine 5‰Û_-phosphate with phenylalanyl-tRNA."
81,1979,Analysis of anaphase in cell culture: an adequate test system for the distinction between compounds which selectively alter the chromosome structure or the mitotic apparatus.,A system of anaphase analysis is presented as an adequate test to detect aberrations in chromosome structure and alterations in the mitotic apparatus. Particular emphasis is placed on those data which suggest that proteins may be the preferred targets of chemical compounds that induce aneuploidy.ImagesFIGURE 1.
82,1979,Analysis of aneuploidy in first-cleavage mouse embryos fertilized in vitro and in vivo.,"First-cleavage mouse embryos, fertilized in vitro and in vivo, provide ideal material for chromosomal analysis. With the appropriate incubation in a mitotic inhibitor, syngamy is prevented and the sperm- and egg-derived chromosomes remain as separate clusters. Because the latter chromosomes undergo condensation sooner than those from the spermatozoon, the parental source of chromosome sets can be identified even without a marker chromosome. Thus these embryos can be analyzed both for the primary incidence and the parental source of a number of chromosomal anomalies, including aneuploidy. By using fertilization in vitro to obtain the embryos, the synchrony of fertilization and nuclear development is such that 80% or more of the chromosomal preparations are suitable for analysis, compared with about 50% for embryos fertilized in vivo.ImagesFIGURE 1.FIGURE 2.FIGURE 3.FIGURE 4."
83,1979,Analysis of mitotic nondisjunction with Aspergillus nidulans.,"Two methods to detect the induction of nondisjunction with a diploid stable strain of A. nidulans are described. The first method gives only qualitative results, while the second method is quantitative and dose-effect curves can be done. Some physiological parameters affecting the induction of nondisjunction can also be studied, because either quiescent or germinating conidia can be treated with the drug under test. Some agents inducing nondisjunction were also tested for the induction of point mutation and somatic crossing-over with these comparative analysis. Two classes of agents inducing nondisjunction may be detected: the first causes all possible types of genetic damage either on quiescent or germinating conidia (a representative of this class is MMS) and acts presumably on the DNA level; the second acts only on germinating conidia and does not produce point mutation or crossing over. A representative of this class is Benomyl which interferes with spindle microtubules. A list of compounds tests is included.ImagesFIGURE 2. aFIGURE 2. b"
84,1979,Analysis of pediatric blood lead levels in New York City for 1970-1976.,"A study was completed of more than 170,000 records of pediatric venous blood levels and supporting demographic information collected in New York City during 1970-1976. The geometric mean (GM) blood lead level shows a consistent cyclical variation superimposed on an overall decreasing trend with time for all ages and ethnic groups studied. The GM blood lead levels for blacks are significantly greater than those for either Hispanics or whites. Regression analysis indicates a significant statistical association between GM blood lead level and ambient air lead level, after appropriate adjustments are made for age and ethnic group. These highly significant statistical relationships provide extremely strong incentives and directions for research into casual factors related to blood lead levels in children."
85,1979,Analysis of RNA secondary structure by photochemical reversal of psoralen crosslinks.,"Aminomethyltrioxsalen (AMT), a psoralen, is known to cause interstrand crosslinks in double stranded nucleic acids. We have demonstrated the photochemical reversal of this reaction, and have used this result to develop a method for identification of specific sequences which are adjacent because of RNA secondary structure formation. E. coli 5S rRNA is used as a model system. We isolated and characterized a product that is derived from the stem region of 5S RNA.Images"
86,1979,Analysis of the attachment of replicating DNA to a nuclear matrix in mammalian interphase nuclei.,"The attachment of replicating DNA to a rapidly sedimenting nuclear structure was investigated by digestion with various nucleases. When DNA was gradually removed by DNase I, pulse label incorporated during either 1 min or during 1 hour in the presence of arabinosylcytosine, remained preferentially attached to the nuclear structure. Single strand specific digestion by nuclease S1 or staphylococcal nuclease at low concentrations caused a release of about 30% of the pulse label, without significantly affecting the attachment of randomly labelled DNA. The released material had a low sedimentation coefficient and contained most of the Okasaki fragments. The remaining pulse label was less accessible to further digestion by double strand specific nuclease activity than the bulk DNA. The results suggest that an attachment of the replication fork to the nuclear structure occurs at sites behind but close to the branch point."
87,1979,Analysis of the high mobility group proteins associated with salt-soluble nucleosomes.,"Two methods have recently been described for the isolation of monomer nucleosomes enriched in transcribed sequences which depend on their solubility in 0.1 M NaCl (Levy, W.B. and Dixon (1978), Nucleic Acid Res., 5, 4155-4163) or solutions containing divalent metal ions (Bloom, K.S. and Anderson, J.N. (1978), Cell, 15, 141-150). Using these procedures the proteins associated with such nucleosomes from rabbit thymus, calf liver and hen oviduct nuclei were isolated and analysed. Increased amounts of proteins HMG14 AND HMG17 and small amounts of HMG1 and HMG2 were found associated with the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 in these nucleosomes. HMG14 and HMG17 were found to be enriched 2 - 7 fold, suggesting an involvement of these two proteins with transcribed sequences. 0.1 M NaCl-soluble monomer nucleosomes prepared by the method of Levy and Dixon were analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and found to be composed of principally two types of particle: 1. Core particles of 145 base pairs of DNA associated with the four core histones only. 2. Nucleosomes with 160 base pairs of DNA associated with the four core histones, increased amounts of HMG14 and 17, and no H1. Small amounts of HMG1 and HMG2 are also detected. These results suggest that HMG14 and HMG17 might be interacting with the 15 base pair linker DNA. A model is presented for the structure of transcriptionally active chromatin.Images"

Incubation of oligoribonucleotides and nbzlppA with RNA ligase yielded oligoribonucleotides having a 3'-o-(o-nitrobenzyl) phosphate. Photochemical removal of the o-nitrobenzyl group provided the free 3'-phosphate. Using [P2-32P] nbzlppA, 3'-termini of oligoribonucleotides could be labelled with 32P. This reaction was applied to modify the 3'-end of donor molecules in joining reaction with RNA ligase. A trinucleotide U-A-G was converted to U-A-Gpnbzl and phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase. pU-A-Gpnbzl was then joined to an acceptor trinucleotide A-U-G to yield A-U-G-U-A-Gp.Images"
96,1979,A new method for the size estimation of the RNA genome segments of influenza virus.,"Previous estimates of the size of the RNA genome segments of influenza virus have been unreliable because of a lack of suitable RNA species as size markers. We have attempted to overcome this problem by utilising the ability of AMV reverse transcriptase to synthesise full length DNA copies of RNA molecules in the presence of a suitable primer. By comparing such DNA copies of the RNA segments of the influenza virus genome with sequenced restriction fragments from the E. coli plasmid pBR322, we have made more reliable estimates of the sizes of the eight genome segments from influenza virus A/NT/60/68.Images"
97,1979,A new series of RNAs associated with the genome of spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) and poly(A)-containing RNA from SFFV-infected cells.,"A series of low molecular weight RNAs (4.5 to 5.5S) as well as other 4 to 7S RNAs were dissociated from genomic RNA of spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) by heating. On two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this series of RNAs gave a series of more than thirty spots. RNase T1 fingerprints of these spots were identical except for differences in 3'-terminal oligonucleotides, which were mainly due to different numbers of uridylic acid residues, larger RNA-molecules containing poly(U)sequences at their 3'-termini. This series of RNAs is also associated with poly(A)-containing nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs from SFFV-infected cells.Images"

99,1979,Animal experimentation and its relevance to man.,"The problem of quantitatively estimating human cancer risk based upon animal carcinogenesis studies is reviewed. Mathematical functions for dose-response relationships are discussed with particular emphasis on multistage models. These models are based upon a single cell somatic mutation theory for the carcinogenesis process. It is shown that the multistage model and others which incorporate background additively are well approximated in low dose region by a linear function. The relationship between time-to-tumor and the multistage model is indicated. This relationship is important when dealing with less than life time exposure such as with data from many occupational studies. Design of bioassay experiments and its impact on risk estimation is noted. Finally, the problem of species-to-species extrapolation is considered."

We describe a direct assay of this enzyme based on separation by thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the substrate ATP and the products 2'5' pppA(pA)n (n larger than or equal to 1). This technique presents obvious advantages compared to the currently used methods. Moreover the enzyme uses other nucleotides as substrates forming co-oligonucleotides 2'5 pppA(pA)n pN (N = U,G,C,dA,dG,dT and dC). Additional procedures are described using different developing solvent systems for the separation of the core-2'5' oligonucleotides (2'5' A(pA)npN) containing AMP-residues entirely and those with another nucleotide at the 2' end.Images"
102,1980,3' Terminal labelling of RNA of RNA with beta-32P-pyrophosphate group and its application to the sequence analysis of 5S RNA from Streptomyces griseus.,"Nucleotide pyrophosphate transferase isolated from Streptomyces griseus is used to transfer pyrophosphate group from gamma-32P-ATP to the 3'-OH of tRNA, generating a strictly terminal label at its 3' end. Using yeast tRNAPhe as model compound, it is demonstrated that the labelled molecule is suitable for rapid gel sequencing by both enzymatic and chemical methods. RNA molecules terminated by pyrimidine nucleoside are poor pyrophosphate acceptors. To label RNAs of this kind, first guanosine 5'-phosphate 3'-(beta-32P)-pyrophosphate (pGpp) is prepared from gamma-32P-ATP and GMP by nucleotide pyrophosphate transferase. pGpp is then ligated to the 3' end of RNA by T4 RNA ligase. The complete nucleotide sequence of 5S RNA from Streptomyces griseus is established by rapid gel sequencing methods performed on 3'-(beta-32P)-pyrophosphate labelled molecule.Images"
103,1980,3'-terminal processing of ribosomal RNA precursors in mammalian cells.,"The 3'-terminal structures of ribosomal 28S RNA and its precursors from rat and mouse were analyzed by means of periodate oxidation followed by reduction with 3H-borohydride. 3'-terminal labeled nucleoside derivatives produced by RNase T2 digestion were determined by thin-layer chromatography and oligonucleotides generated by RNase T1 digestion were analyzed by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. In the rat, the major 3'-terminal sequences of ribosomal 28S RNA, nucleolar 28S, 32S, 41S, and 45S RNAs were YGUoh, GZ2Uoh, GZ12Uoh, GZ2Uoh, and GZ7Goh, respectively, whereas in the mouse corresponding sequences were YGUoh, GZ1,2, or 3Uoh, Goh, Uoh and GZ 13Uoh, respectively. (Y: pyrimidine nucleoside, Z: any nucleoside other than guanosine) These results suggest that a ""transcribed spacer"" sequence is present at the 3'-terminus of the 45S pre-ribosomal RNA, which is gradually removed during the steps of processing."
104,1980,A 300 MHz and 600 MHz proton NMR study of a 12 base pair restriction fragment: investigation of structure by relaxation measurements.,"The 1H NMR spectrum of a 12 base pair DNA restriction fragment has been measured at 300 and 600 MHz and resonances from over 70 protons are individually resolved. Relaxation rate measurements have been carried out at 300 MHz and compared with the theoretical predictions obtained using an isotropic rigid rotor model with coordinates derived from a Dreiding model of DNA. The model gives results that are in excellent agreement with experiment for most protons when a 7 nsec rotational correlation time is used, although agreement is improved for certain base protons by using a shorter correlation time for the sugar group, or by increasing the sugar-base interproton distances. A comparison of non-selective and selective spin-lattice relaxation rates for carbon bound protons indicates that there is extensive spin diffusion even in this short DNA fragment. Examination of the spin-spin relaxation rates for the same type of proton on different base pairs reveals little sequence effect on conformation."
105,1980,A bacterial cell that synthesizes a protein containing the antigenic determinants of rat prolactin.,"Bacterial minicells containing three different recombinant plasmids with rat prolactin cDNA sequences inserted at the Pst I site of pBR322 via the poly(dG):poly(dC) joining technique were examined for the expression of rat prolactin antigenic determinants. The three prolactin coding sequences were in the same orientation as the coding sequence of the ampicillin-resistance gene of pBR322. The presence of each of the three recombinant plasmids induced some prolactin synthesis by the bacteria as measured by immunoprecipitation with anti-prolactin antisera. About 10% of the protein synthesized from one of the plasmids, prl 3, precipitated with the antisera. These prolactin antigenic determinants were part of a larger fused protein.Images"

111,1980,Accessibility of expressed and non-expressed genes to a restriction nuclease.,"Nuclei of mouse liver and an immunoglobulin producing myeloma were digested with HaeIII or its isoschizomer BspRI. The DNA fragment patterns after electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization were very similar for the two types of nuclei when a probe for the non-expressed beta-globin gene was used. The constant (C) region of the kappa light chain gene, on the other hand, was more accessible to the nuclease in myeloma than on liver nuclei. In myeloma nuclei the BspRI sites were about equally sensitive, in fact the pattern resembled a partial digestion pattern of free DNA. In contrast, in liver nuclei some sites were much more protected than others. This is interpreted by assuming that this single copy non-expressed gene region is covered by nucleosomes which are preferentially located on certain DNA sequences. Restriction nuclease digestion of nuclei seems to be a promising method for the analysis of genes in their expressed and non-expressed states.Images"

116,1980,Activation of an internal initiation site for protein synthesis during in vitro translation.,"The major mRNA for adenovirus 2 polypeptide pVIII sediments at 18S as assayed by in vitro translation in the messenger-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. However, a small amount of messenger activity for pVIII sediments at abut 27S, coincident with the mRNA for 100 K. Isolation and fractionation of poly(A) containing RNA following in vitro translation of 27S 100 K mRNA demonstrated the appearance of an 18S messenger activity for pVIII, which is approximately the size of the authentic mRNA for this protein. Partial degradation of 27S 100 K mRNA with alkali or ribonuclease T1 also results in activation of an 18S messenger activity for pVIII suggesting that in vitro messenger activity for pVIII associated with 27S RNA is due to degradation of 100 K mRNA during translation in the cell-free system.Images"
117,1980,Adenovirus terminal protein protects single stranded DNA from digestion by a cellular exonuclease.,"Adenovirus 5 DNA-protein complex is isolated from virions as a duplex DNA molecule covalently attached by the 5' termini of each strand to virion protein of unknown function. The DNA-protein complex can be digested with E. coli exonuclease III to generate molecules analogous to DNA replication intermediates in that they contain long single stranded regions ending in 5' termini bound to terminal protein. The infectivity of pronase digested Adenovirus 5 DNA is greatly diminished by exonuclease III digestion. However, the infectivity of the DNA-protein complex is not significantly altered when up to at least 2400 nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of each strand. This indicates that the terminal protein protects 5' terminated single stranded regions from digestion by a cellular exonuclease. DNA-protein complex prepared from a host range mutant with a mutation mapping in the left 4% of the genome was digested with exonuclease III, hybridized to a wild type restriction fragment comprising the left 8% of the genome, and transfected into HeLa cells. Virus with wild type phenotype was recovered at high frequency.Images"
118,1980,A detailed comparison of the 5'-end of the ovalbumin gene cloned from chicken oviduct and erythrocyte DNA.,"We have examined homologous fragments of DNA cloned from two different tissues for changes in the dNA sequence which might be related to tissue specific gene expression. The 5' end of the chicken ovalbumin gene was cloned from oviduct or erythrocyte DNA DNA using cosmids as vectors. We have compared the two clones obtained by restriction enzyme digestions, analysis of heteroduplexes by electron microscopy or S1 nuclease digestion and by DNA sequencing. Our results show that whereas no alteration occured in the region of the gene assumed to be of importance for the control of transcription, a 4 nucleotide deletion/insertion was detected in the first intron of the ovalbumin gene.Images"
119,1980,A DNA glycosylase from Escherichia coli that releases free urea from a polydeoxyribonucleotide containing fragments of base residues.,"A poly (dA, [2-14C]dT) copolymer has been synthesized using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Treatment of the polydeoxyribonucleotide with potassium permanganate converts the thymine residues to urea and N-substituted urea derivatives, while the adenine residues are resistant to oxidation. This damaged polymer has been annealed with an equimolar amount of poly (dT) to generate a double-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotide containing scattered fragmented base residues, which are radioactively labeled selectively. On incubation of the latter with crude cell extracts from E. coli, free urea is released by a DNA glycosylase activity. The enzyme has been partly purified, and appears to be different from previously studied DNA glycosylase. It shows a strong preference for a double-stranded substrate, exhibits no cofactor requirement, and has a molecular weight of 20000 - 25000. Since fragmentation of pyrimidine residues is a major type of base lesion introduced in DNA by exposure to ionizing radiation, it seems likely this DNA glycosylase is active in repair of X-ray-induced lesions."
120,1980,"A family of long reiterated DNA sequences, one copy of which is next to the human beta globin gene.","An unusually long repeated DNA sequence was identified in cloned DNA, three kb 3' to the human beta-globin gene. Other members of this repeated sequence family were isolated from a human genomic DNA library and characterized by Southern blotting techniques, electron microscopy, and solution hybridization. The copy located next to the beta-globin gene was found to be 6.4 +/- 0.2 kb long and continuous over that length. This repeated sequence family comprises about 1% of the human genome and contains 3000-4800 copies of moderate sequence divergence which are interspersed with other less-highly repeated DNA. The 6.4 kb repeated unit does not appear to be composed of any smaller tandemly repeated subunits, nor is it expressed at a high level in bone marrow cell RNA.Images"
121,1980,A family of moderately repetitive sequences in mouse DNA.,"When mouse DNA is digested to completion with restriction endonuclease Eco R1, a distinct band of 1.3 kb segments comprising about 0.5-3% of the genome is observed upon agarose gel electrophoresis. This DNA is not tandemly repeated in the genome and is not derived from mouse satellite DNA. Restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the 1.3 kb segments are heterogeneous. Specific sequences were selected from the 1.3 kb segments and amplified by cloning in plasmid pBR322. Southern transfer experiments indicated that three separately cloned mouse DNA inserts hybridized predominantly to the Eco R1 1.3 kb band and to the conspicuous subsegments generated by secondary restriction endonuclease cleavage of the sucrose gradient purified 1.3 kb segments. Segments were also excised by Hha I (Hha I segments) from the chimeric plasmids containing mouse DNA inserts and subjected to restriction endonuclease and cross-hybridization analysis. It was found that the three Hha I segments were different, although two of them exhibited partial sequence homology. Cot analysis indicated that each of the Hha I segments are repeated about 10(4) times in the mouse genome. These findings indicate that a family of related but non-identical, moderately repetitive DNA sequences, rather than a single homogeneous repeat, is present in the 1.3 kb Eco R1 band.Images"
122,1980,Affinity labeling of eukaryotic elongation factors using N epsilon-bromoacetyl-Lys-tRNA.,"eEF-T and eEF-Tu from rabbit reticulocyte and from Artemia were affinity labeled using N epsilon-bromoacetyl-Lys-tRNA prepared with either yeast or E. coli tRNA. Only the eEF-Tu polypeptide was crosslinked when eEF-T was incubated with the reactive aminoacyl-tRNA analogue, which indicates that at least part of the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site is the same in both eEF-Tu and the multisubunit eEF-T. Complex formation (eEF-Tu x aa-tRNA x GTP) was required for crosslinking, since no covalent reaction with eEF-Tu occurred in the absence of GTP. The yield of crosslinked product was greatly reduced by adding either unmodified rabbit liver aminoacyl-tRNA or unmodified E. coli Lys-tRNA to the incubation to compete for the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site on eEF-T or eEF-Tu, indicating that the covalent reaction occurs while the N epsilon-bromoacetyl-Lys-tRNA is bound in this site. The affinity labeling of a prokaryotic and two different eukaryotic elongation factors by the same reagent suggests that there may be conservation of structure in the region of the proteins which binds the aminoacyl end of the aminoacyl-tRNA."
123,1980,Air pollution and human health: a review and reanalysis.,"Since 1970, Lave and Seskin have published a series of articles dealing with the question, ""Does air pollution shorten lives?"" Their recent book reports revised and extended analyses of their previous studies emphasizing policy implications. We have undertaken a review of Lave and Seskin's book to evaluate the methodology used and hence gain some insight into the strength of the conclusions reached. This review concentrates on methodology and its application to establishing and quantifying the association between air quality and health. Beyond simply reviewing the analyses reported in Lave and Seskin's book, we have duplicated and expanded two of the reported analyses. Our detailed reanalysis is presented both to verify reported results, and to illustrate the difficulties encountered in such an analysis. Our overall conclusion is that Lave and Seskin have done a thorouth job of reporting and interpreting the various analyses that they performed. Lave and Seskin have made a pioneering effort in showing an association between mortality rates and air pollution. We do not disagree with the conclusion of the existence of an association but have some reservations about their methods of estimating its magnitude. We were particularly concerned that Lave and Seskin did not fully investigate how well their models fit these data. Our reanalysis results in estimated effects which differ considerably from the values reported by Lave and Seskin. Thus, we conclude that the regression coefficients are quite unstable and so must be used with care. Assessing the relative costs and benefits of reducing air pollution without extensive sensitivity analysis could, therefore, be misleading."
124,1980,Alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila: isolation and characterization of messenger RNA and cDNA clone.,"The mRNA for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in D. melanogaster has been identified by translation in a cell-free system. The in vitro synthesized polypeptide, specifically precipitated by anti-ADH antibody, has identical subunit molecular weight (25,000 daltons) and tryptic peptide profile to the in vivo synthesized ADH. The poly A containing ADH-mRNA has been purified by specific precipitation of ADH-polysomes using anti-ADH antibody and S. aureus. Transformation of E. coli with the dA-tailed ADH-mRNA-complementary DNA hybrid annealed to the dT-tailed pBR322 yielded one plasmid which has been identified as the ADH-cDNA clone. The identification involved hybridization selection of ADH-mRNA and in vitro translation, in situ hybridization to the Adh locus on salivary gland polytene chromosomes and DNA sequencing. This ADH-cDNA plasmid contains 349 bases of the C-terminal protein coding and 180 bases of the 3' untranslated region.Images"
125,1980,Alterations in tRNA isoaccepting species during erythroid differentiation of the Friend leukemia cell.,"The chromatographic profiles of isoaccepting tRNAs were analyzed at five time points during the 96 hr, dimethylsulfoxide induced, erythroid-like differentiation of Friend leukemia cells. Sixty-four isoaccepting species of tRNA for 16 amino acids were resolved by RPC-5 chromatography. The relative amounts of tRNAphe, tRNAile, and tRNAval species were maintained by the cells during differentiation; whereas the relative amounts of some of the isoacceptor tRNAs for the other 13 amino acids changed significantly. Fluctuations in amounts of isoacceptors occurred between 36 and 72 hr after addition of dimethysulfoxide, corresponding to globin mRNA appearance and hemoglobin synthesis, respectively. In most cases, thepredominant tRNA isoacceptors of uninduced cells were retained throughout differentiation. Notable exceptions were tRNA species for threonine, proline, and methionine. Some of the isoacceptors occurring in relatively smaller amounts were not expressed at all times. These changes possibly reflect the cell's functional adaptation of tRNA in differentiation for hemoglobin synthesis."
126,1980,Alterations in two conserved regions of promoter sequence lead to altered rates of polymerase binding and levels of gene expression.,"Characterization of recombinant lac promoters highlights the importance of two regions of sequence conservation in promoters.

However, changing the upstream DNA sequences influences both the rate of RNA polymerase binding in vitro and levels of expression in vivo.Images"
127,1980,"A mammalian mitochondrial serine transfer RNA lacking the ""dihydrouridine"" loop and stem.","A unique transfer RNA has been identified in human and bovine mitochondria that lacks the ""dihydrouridine"" loop and stem structure. This tRNA is mitochondrially coded as shown by DNA sequence analysis of the human and bovine mitochondrial DNA. Sequence analysis of the RNA shows that it is post-transcriptionally modified by the addition of CCA at the 3' terminus and that at least one base is modified. As predicted by its anticodon (GCU, corresponding to the serine codons AGU/C) this tRNA can be aminoacylated with serine when purified mitochondria are incubated in a medium containing 3H-serine.Images"

It was tested on a series of proteins with known coding DNA sequences and a series of plasmid cloned cDNAs made from pure chicken globin mRNA."

We have isolated and characterised a recombinant plasmid containing cDNA copies of the IF2 mutant mRNA. The cloned sequence extends from the nucleotides coding for amino acid 96 in the variable region through 100 nucleotides of untranslated region at the 3' end. The sequence of the cDNA insert reveals no discontinuity at the variable-hinge region junction, the site of the CH1 deletion. Experiments employing direct priming on the poly(A) tail of the IF2 heavy chain mRNA suggest that the 3' end of the cDNA clone (sequence C-C-C-T-G-C) is also the 3' end of the mRNA.Images"

133,1980,"Analysis of DNA double- and single-strand breaks by two dimensional electrophoresis: action of micrococcal nuclease on chromatin and DNA, and degradation in vivo of lens fiber chromatin.","We describe a novel system for two dimensional electrophoresis at neutral and alkaline pH for determining the double-stranded and single-stranded lengths of DNA. With this system we analysed the mode of micrococcal nuclease digestion of DNA in cellular and SV40 viral chromatin and of supercoiled SV40 DNA. The enzyme reaction occurred in two steps : the enzyme first introduced single-strand breaks, then converted these to double-strand breaks by an adjacent cleavage on the opposite strand. Digestion of cellular chromatin DNA occurred by a similar mechanism. Chromatin fragments produced by limited micrococcal nuclease action contained many single-strand breaks, which may be important when this method is used to prepare chromatin fragments for biochemical and biophysical studies. Nucleosome monomer to tetramer produced at later stages of digestion contained few if any single-strand breaks.Images"
134,1980,Analysis of recombination in mammalian cells using SV40 genome segments having homologous overlapping termini.,"Segments of SV40 DNA having homologous overlapping termini recombine to produce viable genomes in monkey cells. Frequencies of recombination on either side of a deletion marker are non-random; replication and palindromes do not appear to be essential. Since recombination involves host enzymes, a suitable system has been devised for analysing host cell recombination functions.Images"
135,1980,Analysis of the regions flanking the human insulin gene and sequence of an Alu family member.,"The regions around the human insulin gene have been studied by heteroduplex, hybridization and sequence analysis. These studies indicated that there is a region of heterogeneous length located approximately 700 bp before the 5' end of the gene; and that the 19 kb of cloned DNA which includes the 1430 bp insulin gene as well as 5650 bp before and 11,500 bp after the gene is single copy sequence except for 500 bp located 6000 bp from the 3' end of the gene. This 500 bp segment contains a member of the Alu family of dispersed middle repetitive sequences as well as another less highly repeated homopolymeric segment. The sequence of this region was determined. This Alu repeat is bordered by 19 bp direct repeats and also contains an 83 bp sequence which is present twice. The regions flanking the human and rat I insulin genes were compared by heteroduplex analysis to localize homologous sequences in the flanking regions which could be involved in the regulation of insulin biosynthesis. The homology between the two genes is restricted to the region encoding preproinsulin and a short region of approximately 60 bp flanking the 5' side of the genes.Images"
136,1980,Analysis of the secondary and tertiary structures of Rous sarcoma virus RNA.,"The secondary and tertiary structures of the 35S RNA of Rous Sarcoma virus have been investigated. T1 RNase partial digests have been first resolved into their components by gel electrophoresis under non denaturing conditions and then each component analyzed further by various techniques. More than one hundred structured fragments have thus been isolated and shown to consist of several individual nucleotide sequences located far apart on the genome. On the basis of the results, a cloverleaf model for the structure of RSV 35S RNA is proposed that has implications for the various biological functions of this RNA.Images"

These programs will perform all the manipulations that are required on data gained by the so-called 'shotgun' method of DNA sequencing. This system simplifies the computer processing involved with this sequencing method and also has the capability of being able at any time during a project to display, lined up in register, all the gel reading covering any section of the sequence."
145,1980,A new conformation-specific infrared band of A-DNA in films.,"A band at 1185 cm-1 occurs in the infrared spectra of nucleic acids in their A-type conformation which has been reproduced in the literature, too. The absorbance of this band is proportional to the fraction of the A form of DNA samples containing a mixture of different forms. The 1185 cm-1 band has been assigned tentatively to a vibration of the sugar-phosphate backbone with a fairly high contribution from the sugar moiety. Drastic dehydration of the DNA films is accompanied by a continuous intensity decrease of the 1185 cm-1 band indicating a collapse of the A form."

The enzyme recognizes the sequence (see formula index) and cleaves at the position indicated by the arrows. The enzyme preparation obtained is suitable for restriction mapping an ligation.Images"
147,1980,An examination of models for chromatin transcription.,"Structural studies have revealed that chromatin is composed of repeating units or nucleosomes having two distinct domains, the nucleosome core and the linker region. The nucleosome core comprises 146 base pairs of DNA wound in one and three quarter turns around an octamer of histones made up of two symmetrical tetramers (1). It may be inferred on topological grounds that this structure must be perturbed during chromatin transcription and replication since the histone core bridges the supercoil which blocks the passage of polymerase along the template and prevents the unwinding of DNA required for enzymatic copying. A number of mechanisms for freeing the DNA template may be envisaged, and one detailed model, based on symmetrical dissociation of the histone tetramers, has been proposed (2). Here we present evidence against such unpairing or indeed any detachment of histones from the octamer during chromatin transcription, and we give reasons for favouring a transcriptional mechanism based upon the separation of the octamer from at least one of the DNA.Images"
148,1980,An experimentally-derived model for the secondary structure of the 16S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli.,"Ribonucleoprotein fragments are isolated by mild ribonuclease digestion of E. coli 30S ribosomal subunits, and are deproteinized and subjected to a second partial digestion. Base-pairing between the resulting small RNA fragments is investigated using the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis procedure already reported (see Ref. 1). The interactions thus found are incorporated into a secondary structure model covering approximately 80% of the 16S RNA.Images"
149,1980,Angiotensin-converting enzyme: II. Pulmonary endothelial cells in culture.,"Direct studies of the function of a given cell type often require that the cell type be obtained in pure culture. A number of different specific metabolic activities have been attributed to pulmonary endothelial cells, yet with few exceptions the conclusions were based on indirect evidence. Thus, to improve our ability to examine directly for specific metabolic activities, we began a program to obtain pulmonary endothelial cells in culture. Two methods have been developed: (1) cells can be obtained from pulmonary artery and vein of large animals (cow, pig), and (2) cells can be obtained from the microvasculature of small animals (rat, guinea pig, and rabbit). The latter technique can also be used to obtain cells from a lobe of lung from large animals and may be adaptable for use with human tissue. In the first technique, pulmonary arteries, free of blood, are filled with collagenase (0.25%, 500 units) in Puck's saline for 25 min. The collagenase mixture containing cells is removed and centrifuged. The pellet is resuspended and seeded into culture flasks. In the second method, lungs are perfused (artery to vein) with Krebs-Henseleit solution until the effluent is blood-free. Collagenase (0.25%, 500 units) is introduced, and the lungs are then perfused in the opposite direction (vein to artery) until the flow stops spontaneously (ca. 15 min). The detached cells are collected and seeded as before. The endothelial cells attach as small clumps (10-50 cells). Those flasks which contain more than 95% endothelial cells (by phase microscopy) are retained for culture and the lines are purified usng differential adherence procedures.The cells grow as monolayers with a cobblestone appearance. They contain Weibel-Palade bodies. They possess converting enzyme activity and are reactive with antibodies to converting enzyme, Factor VIII and alpha 2-macroglobulin. The cells synthesize prostaglandins and related substances. In addition, they possess ADPase and synthesize angiotensin-converting enzyme.ImagesFIGURE 1.FIGURE 2.FIGURE 3.FIGURE 4.FIGURE 5.FIGURE 6."
150,1980,Angiotensin-converting enzyme: I. New strategies for assay,"The disposition of converting enzyme (kininase II) on the luminal surface of pulmonary endothelial cells is well established. Further, it is known that there is a net conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II as blood passes through the lungs. However, little is known about modulations of converting enzyme activity that may arise through, e.g., changes in the quality of inhalants, blood flow, or blood oxygenation. There are few data on the effects of lung disease. A major barrier to studies to examine for pathophysiologic modulations of converting enzyme is that of assay. The enzyme can be measured in terms of the rate of formation of angiotensin II from a known quantity of angiotensin I. However, both peptides are biologically active, and lungs contain other enzymes capable of degrading them. We have developed a series of radiolabeled, acylated tripeptides to improve our ability to examine for changes in the net converting enzyme of intact lungs. The enzyme, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is capable of removing C-terminal dipeptides from a variety of oligopeptides. We have prepared benzoyl-Gly-Gly-Gly (I), benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg (II), benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu (III), benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (IV), and benzoyl-Phe-His-Leu (V), each containing a 3H-atom in the para position of the benzoyl moiety. Substrates I and III have been used previously in photometric assays of low sensitivity. II is the acylated C-terminal tripeptide of bradykinin, IV is an acylated tripeptide analog of BPP5a (&lt;Glu-Lys-Trp-Ala-Pro) and V is the acylated C-terminal tripeptide of angiotensin I. These substrates can be used in vitro or in vivo to measure converting enzyme. The 3H-labeled product is separable by partitioning between an organic solvent and acidified aqueous solution. The product is quantified by scintillation counting of the organic phase. The choice of substrate depends on the goals of the experiment: substrate I or III when wide variations in substrate concentrations are needed but high sensitivity is not; substrate IV when high sensitivity is needed."
151,1981,16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli contains a N2-methylguanosine at 27 nucleotides from the 3' end.,"The 49 nucleotides fragment derived from the 3' end of 16S rRNA by cloacin DF13, is not cleaved by ribonuclease T1 at a guanosine residue tha is present at 27 nucleotides from the 3' terminus (position 115 in 16S rRNA). Analysis of the isolated nucleotide indicates that it is a modified G residue. In vivo labeling with (3H)methionine shows that this G is methylated and co-chromatography with markers reveals that it is N2-methylguanosine.Images"
152,1981,1H NMR studies of lac-operator DNA fragments.,The hydrogen-bonded imino protons of a 14 base pair double-stranded DNA fragment comprising one half of the lac operator of E. coli were investigated by 360 MHz H NMR. From combined melting studies of this synthetic 14 b.p. fragment and its two constituent 7 b.p. fragments a nearly complete assignment for the low-field proton resonances was obtained. The experimental spectra are compared with calculated spectra and with the spectrum of a 51 b.p. DNA restriction fragment from E. coli containing the complete lac operator. Structural information on these oligonucleotides is presented. This study is a prerequisite for future 1H NMR investigations of the interaction of the lac operator with the lac repressor.

The determination was mainly based in this ultraviolet absorption spectra and mass spectrometric analysis of the trimethylsilyl derivative.
154,1981,5S ribosomal RNA genes of the newt Notophthalmus viridescens.,"The genes which code for the 5S ribosomal RNA in the newt, Notophthalmus viridescens have been cloned and analyzed. Two types of repeating unit were detected: a major type consisting of a 120 bp coding region with a 111 bp spacer, and a minor type composed of a coding region, a pseudogene, and a 113 bp spacer. The pseudogene is a 36 bp segment which corresponds to the 3' terminal third of the 5S RNA gene, and is situated immediately 3' to the gene, being separated from it by 2 bp. Two recombinant plasmids were obtained in which the major and minor units were arranged in an interspersed pattern.Images"
155,1981,5'-Terminal sequences of eucaryotic mRNA can be cloned with high efficiency.,"A method for cloning mRNAs has been used which results in a high yield of recombinants containing complete 5'-terminal mRNA sequences. It is not dependent on self-priming to generate double-stranded DNA and therefore the S1 nuclease digestion step is not required. Instead, the cDNA is dCMP-tailed at its 3'-end with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The synthesis of the second strand is primed by oligo(dG) hybridized to the 3'-tail. Double-stranded cDNA is subsequently tailed with dCTP and annealed to dGMP-tailed vector DNA. This approach overcomes the loss of the 5'-terminal mRNA sequences and the problem of artifacts which may be introduced into cloned cDNA sequences. Chicken lysozyme cDNA was cloned into pBR322 by this procedure with a transformation efficiency of 5 x 10(3) recombinant clones per ng of ds-cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed that at least nine out of nineteen randomly isolated plasmids contained the entire 5'-untranslated mRNA sequence. The data strongly support the conclusion that the 5'-untranslated region of the lysozyme mRNA is heterogeneous in length.Images"

160,1981,Abundant androgen regulated mRNAs in mouse submandibular gland: cell-free translation of renin precursor mRNA.,"Submandibular glands of male mice contain at least four abundant mRNAs that occur at low concentrations in glands of females. The male-specific mRNAs code for polypeptides of 48,000, 43,000, 29,000, and 27,000 MW. Androgenic regulation of these mRNAs is illustrated by their apparent absence in glands of castrate males and by their accumulation in glands of females treated with testosterone. Selective hybrid-arrested translation experiments also indicate reduced levels of these male-specific sequences in female gland cytoplasm. The 48,000 MW male-specific polypeptide is reduced in translation products directed by gland mRNA from C57BL10/J mice (variants deficient in salivary renin), suggesting the corresponding mRNA codes for a renin precursor. The identity of this polypeptide is confirmed by immune selection with renin-specific antibody.Images"

The method is based upon selective chemical modification of 5'-triphosphate groups by an antigen-containing amine followed by affinity chromatography on an absorbent loaded with antibodies specific to this antigen. A purification factor up to 37 may be achieved.
163,1981,A chicken middle-repetitive DNA sequence which shares homology with mammalian ubiquitous repeats.,"We have identified and sequenced two members of a chicken middle repetitive DNA sequence family. By reassociation kinetics, members of this family (termed CRl) are estimated to be present in 1500-7000 copies per chicken haploid genome. The first family member sequenced (CRlUla) is located approximately 2 kb upstream from the previously cloned chicken Ul RNA gene. The second CRl sequence (CRl)Va) is located approximately 12 kb downstream from the 3' end of the chicken ovalbumin gene. The region of homology between these two sequences extends over a region of approximately 160 base pairs. In each case, the 160 base pair region is flanked by imperfect, but homologous, short direct repeats 10-15 base pairs in length. When the CRl sequences are compared with mammalian ubiquitous interspersed repetitive DNA sequences (human Alu and Mouse Bl families), several regions of extensive homology are evident. In addition, the short nucleotide sequence CAGCCTGG which is completely conserved in ubiquitous repetitive sequence families from several mammalian species is also conserved at a homologous position in the chicken sequences. These data imply that at least certain aspects of the sequence and structure of these interspersed repeats must predate the avian-mammalian divergence. It seems that the CRl family may possibly represent an avian counterpart of the mammalian ubiquitous repeats.Images"
164,1981,A conversational system for the computer analysis of nucleic acid sequences.,We present a conversational system for the computer analysis of nucleic acid and protein sequences based on the well-known Queen and Korn program (1). The system can be used by persons with only minimal knowledge of computers.
165,1981,A coupled transcription-translation system from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and its application to study Ti plasmid expression in vitro.,"A coupled transcription-translation system was isolated from A. tumefaciens. Expression of plasmids pBR322 and pKT212 from E.coli, cloned fragments of Ti plasmid (plasmids pSS155 and pSS156) and Ti plasmid derivatives pAL2802, pAL2811, pAL2821 and pAL2832 was analysed in an A. tumefaciens cell-free system and compared with their expression in an E.coli cell-free system. New proteins of 41K and 44K appeared in A tumefaciens extracts, as the result of Ti plasmid expression. These proteins were not found in E.coli extracts.Images"
166,1981,Adenosine dimethylation of 16S ribosomal RNA: effect of the methylgroups on local conformational stability as deduced from electrophoretic mobility of RNA fragments in denaturing polyacrylamide gels.,"The electrophoretic mobility of RNA fragments derived from the 3'-end of 16S rRNA on slabs of polyacrylamide gel in the presence of urea is strongly influenced by dimethylation of the N6-aminogroup of two adjacent adenosines. This is not due to the presence of the methylgroups per se, but must be ascribed to an effect of methylation on long range intramolecular interactions at these denaturing conditions. When it is assumed that the electrophoretic mobilities of the RNA fragments in the polyacrylamide matrix are determined by the conformational state(s) of the fragments, dimethylation of the adenosines leads in the smaller fragments to a less compact average conformation and in the larger fragments to a more compact average conformation. An effort is made to comprehend the effects of adenosine dimethylation in terms of secondary structure based on nucleotide sequence.Images"
167,1981,Adenovirus late sequences linked to herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase may be introduced into eukaryotic cells and transcribed.,"LTK-cells have been transformed to the TK+ phenotype by treatment with size-defined concatamers of HSV-1 TK DNA and Ad2 Bam H1 C fragment (42.0 - 59.5 map units). All TK+ transformants contained Ad2 DNA as well as HSV-1 TK sequences. In most cases several inserts of virus DNA were present, many in high copy numbers. Although no Ad2 transcription promoter was present in the transforming DNA, Ad2-specific sequences were detected in polyadenylated cytoplasmic RNA species from several cell lines.Images"
168,1981,Adh locus in maize for detection of mutagens in the environment.,The advantages of the maize Adh system for low level mutagenesis studies are discussed. They include high mutation rate and the availability of both a strong selection system for null mutants and a sensitive method for detection of variants. The null selection involves treatment of pollen with allyl alcohol which is converted by the Adh enzyme to the toxic acrylaldehyde. Adh variants can be detected by alteration in affinity for phytic acid as well as thermal stability and electrophoretic mobility.

170,1981,A gel electrophoresis method for quantifying the binding of proteins to specific DNA regions: application to components of the Escherichia coli lactose operon regulatory system.,"The use of gel electrophoresis for quantitative studies of DNA-protein interactions is described. This rapid and simple technique involves separation of free DNA from DNA-protein complexes based on differences in their electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels. Under favorable conditions both unbound DNA and DNA associated with protein can be quantified. This gel method is applied to the study of the E. coli lactose operon regulatory system. At ionic strengths in the physiological range, the catabolite activator protein (CAP) is shown to form a long-lived complex with the wild type lac promotor, but not with a CAP-insensitive mutant. Formation of a stable ""open"" or ""melted-in"" complex of RNA polymerase with the wild type promoter requires the participation of CAP and cyclic AMP. Further, it is demonstrated that even when pre-formed in the presence of CAP-cAMP, the polymerase-promoter open complex becomes unstable if CAP is then selectively removed.Images"
171,1981,A general approach for purifying proteins encoded by cloned genes without using a functional assay: isolation of the uvrA gene product from radiolabeled maxicells.,"The uvrA protein (UVRA) of E. coli has been extensively purified from a strain in which UVRA is overproduced and specifically labeled with 35S-methionine. This approximately 100-fold overproduction relative to normal strains is a result of having the uvrA gene present on a multicopy plasmid in a spr recA cell that makes defective lexA protein, the normal repressor of the uvrA gene, while the specific labeling of UVRA is done with maxicells. This approach facilitates the preparation of the protein since enzyme assays do not have to be carried out during the intermediate stages of purification. The purified UVRA binds to DNA and has ATPase activity but does not have intrinsic endonuclease activity. When added to extracts of uvrA- cells, the purified UVRA does promote the specific cutting of UV-irradiated DNA. Since this approach for working out rapid purification procedures by specifically labeling the proteins encoded by cloned genes does not require the use of a functional assay, it is a general one that can be applied to a wide variety of other gene products in addition to UVRA.Images"
172,1981,A hydrogen exchange study of Escherichia coli 5S RNA.,"Using the tritium Sephadex method, the number of exchangeable protons in E. coli 5S RNA and the kinetics of their exchange reactions have been measured at two different Mg++ concentrations (10(-2) M and 10(-3) M). A quantitative analysis of these results indicates the presence of two classes of protons exchanging with very different rates. The protons of the slow class, not seen in linear molecules of double helical RNA, exchange with a half-time of 0.6 hour and their exchange kinetics are independent of Mg++ concentration. Reduction of the Mg++ concentration from 10(-2) ot 10(-3) M, however, results in a decrease in the number of these exchangeable protons form 26 to 19. Neither the total number, nor the exchange kinetics of the fast protons are affected by this change in Mg++ concentration. Comparison of these results with those previously obtained with tRNA, suggests the presence of a Mg++ dependent tertiary structure in 5S RNA. The number of exchangeable protons obtained from extrapolation of the exchange curves (120 and 126 respectively for 10(-3) and 10(-2) M Mg++ concentration) are compared to the calculated number of exchangeable protons predicted by previous proposed structural models for E.Coli 5S RNA."
173,1981,Albumin is encoded by 2 messenger RNAs in Xenopus laevis.,"A cDNA clone library was prepared from liver poly(A) RNA pf non-estrogenized Xenopus laevis. Albumin coding sequences were screened by hybridization to a cDNA prepared from poly(A) RNA enriched by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and by a sensitive solid-phase radioimmunoassay to detect clones that contain templates for albumin antigenic determinants. Nine clones were obtained by this approach, and all but one have the cDNA inserted in phase with the beta-lactamase gene of pBR322. Mapping of these clones with restriction endonucleases yielded 2 distinct patterns, suggestive of heterogeneity in the coding sequences. This was confirmed by heteroduplex analyses of hybrids formed between clones representative of each of the 2 classes. Both classes of albumin cDNA clones were used to select mRNAs of the same size (2.3kb) that code for peptides that are indistinguishable by SDS gel electrophoresis. Examination of the organization of the albumin genes by blot hybridization of the cDNA clones to restriction fragments of Xenopus DNA failed to detect any differences at the genomic level. The considerable diversity of the albumin cDNAs is suggestive of a multiplicity of albumin genes, rather than differential processing of a common precursor RNA.Images"

175,1981,Alignment of the amino terminal amino acid sequence of human cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II with the sequence of their putative mRNAs.,"Thirteen of the first fifteen amino acids from the NH2-terminus of the primary sequence of human cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and eleven of the first twelve amino acids of subunit II have been identified by microsequencing procedures. These sequences have been compared with the recently determined 5'-end proximal sequences of the HeLa cell mitochondrial mRNAs and unambiguously aligned with two of them. This alignment has allowed the identification of the putative mRNA for subunit I, and has shown that the initiator codon for this subunit is only three nucleotides away from the 5'-end of its mRNA; furthermore, the results have substantiated the idea that the translation of human cytochrome c oxidase subunit II starts directly at the 5'-end of its putative mRNA, as had been previously inferred on the basis of the sequence homology of human mitochondrial DNA with the primary sequences of the bovine subunit.Images"
176,1981,Altered features in the secondary structure of Vicia faba 5.8s rRNA.,"We have re-examined the nucleotide sequence of Vicia faba (broad bean) 5.8S rRNA using partial chemical degradation and a new approach to high temperature (65-80 degrees C) sequencing gels. The results indicate that the secondary structure was not completely disrupted in previous studies (Tanaka, Y., Dyer, T.A. and Brownlee, G.G. (1980) Nucleic Acid Res. 8, 1259-1272) and explain ambiguities between the nucleotide sequence and T1 ribonuclease digests. Despite this revision, estimates in the secondary structure suggest that this 5.8S rRNA differs from previously examined examples in two respects, more open conformations in both the ""GC-rich"" and ""AU-rich"" stems. The secondary structure was probed under a variety of ionic conditions using limited pancreatic and T1 ribonuclease digestion and rapid gel sequencing techniques. These studies and theoretical considerations generally supported the ""burp gun"" model previously proposed for all 5.8S rRNAs and were inconsistent with the recently suggested ""cloverleaf"" configuration. More importantly, they were also consistent with more open stem structures in this higher plant.Images"
177,1981,Altered mobility of polydeoxyribonucleotides in high resolution polyacrylamide gels due to removal of terminal phosphates.,"We have compared the electrophoretic mobility of a series of polynucleotides differing solely by the presence or absence of a terminal phosphate. As expected, the effect of removal of a single terminal phosphoryl residue on electrophoretic mobility is dependent on the size of the polynucleotide and therefore is not constant. Removal of a phosphoryl residue from polynucleotides shorter than 30 nucleotides reduces the mobility the equivalent of one nucleotide. Between 30 and 50 nucleotides the reduction in mobility is approximately one-half a nucleotide, while above 50 nucleotides in size the effect of phosphate removal approaches zero.Images"
178,1981,Alternative pathways for editing non-cognate amino acids by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.,"Evidence is presented that the editing mechanisms of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase operate by two alternative pathways: pre-transfer, by hydrolysis of the non-cognate aminoacyl adenylate; post-transfer, by hydrolysis of the mischarged tRNA. The methionyl-tRNA synthetases from Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase from E. coli, for example, are shown to reject misactivated homocysteine rapidly by the pre-transfer route. A novel feature of this reaction is that homocysteine thiolactone is formed by the facile cyclisation of the homocysteinyl adenylate. Valyl-tRNA synthetases, on the other hand, reject the more readily activated non-cognate amino acids by primarily the post-transfer route. The features governing the choice of pathway are discussed."
179,1981,A member of a new repeated sequence family which is conserved throughout eucaryotic evolution is found between the human delta and beta globin genes.,"A new class of human interspersed repeated sequences distinct from the AluI family was found by screening a human gene library with a mouse ribosomal gene non-transcribed spacer probe (rDNA NTS). A member of this sequence family was localized to a 251 bp segment between the human delta and beta globin genes: a region previously judged to be devoid of repeated DNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of this segment revealed a tandem block of 17 TG dinucleotides, a feature hypothesized by others to be a recombination hot spot responsible for gene conversion in the gamma globin locus region. When the genomes of Xenopus, pigeon, slime mold and yeast were examined, reiterated sequences homologous to both the mouse rDNA NTS and human globin repeat were found in every case. The discovery of this extraordinarily conserved repeated sequence family appears to have depended upon not using salmon sperm DNA during hybridization. The use of eucaryotic carrier DNA may bias the search for repeated sequences against any which may be highly conserved during eucaryotic evolution.Images"

The obtained kinetic data are in agreement with a mechanism of ordered product release with pppApU being released first from the central complex. A minimal general mechanism for abortive initiation satisfying the kinetic results is given. The stimulation of transcription of T7 DNA by pppApU at low substrate concentrations was investigated.
183,1981,A molecular mechanical study of complexes formed between 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and dinucleoside phosphates.,"Molecular mechanical calculations were done on complexes of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQO) with various dinucleoside phosphates [(ApT)2, (CpG)2, (GpC)2, and (TpA)2]. Models built using proflavine (uniform C3' endo sugar puckers) and acridine orange (mixed C3' endo (3'-5') C2' endo sugar puckers) dinucleoside phosphate X-ray structures were used in the calculations. Relative binding energies, complex geometries, and various intercalator orientations in the complexes were studied. The results suggest qualitatively different geometries for pyr-(3'-5')-pur and pur-(3'-5')-pyr sequences. Specifically, we find marked distortion in some of the complexes (i.e. there is not a parallel coplanar relationship between the base pairs and intercalator), distortion of the NQO nitro group from planarity in the complexes and mobility of NQO in the intercalation site. We suggest that experimental studies of NQO-dinucleoside phosphate complexes may reveal intercalation complexes which deviate substantially more from a nearly parallel coplanar arrangement of bases and intercalator than has been previously observed."
184,1981,Analysis of reconstruction of an RNP particle which stores 5S RNA and tRNA in amphibian oocytes.,"Previtellogenic oocytes of Triturus cristatus accumulate a free cytoplasmic RNP which sediments at 40S and contain 5S RNA and tRNA in association with two proteins of MW 45,000 and 39,000 daltons (P45 and P39). The 40S particle has a buoyant density of 1.53 g . cm-3 in CsCl and consists of four identical RNP subunits. Each monomeric subunit contains one molecule of 5S RNA, three molecules of tRNA, two molecules of P45 and one molecule of P39. The 40S particle can be completely dissociated by SDS treatment into its individual components, and the subunits, and even the complete 40S particle, can be reformed by removal of SDS in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl. RNA/protein binding experiments with isolated components, and analysis of reformed RNP complexes in CsCl gradients, demonstrate that the stable interactions are: 5S RNA/P45, 3(tRNA)/P45, 5S RNA/P39 and 5S RNA/P45/P39. Immunological studies show that P45 has also a nuclear location and may bind to the 5S RNA transcript in the chromatin, whereas P39 is predominantly cytoplasmic and is possibly related to proteins associated with 5S RNA in the ribosomal 60S subunit. It is suggested that the 40S RNP particle not only stores 5S RNA and tRNA but also provides a means for the exchange of the 5S RNA transcript binding protein (P45) for the 5S RNA ribosome associated protein (P39).Images"
185,1981,Analysis of the DNA and RNA changes associated with the expression of isotypic variant-specific antigens of trypanosomes.,"Using specific (32P) labelled cDNA probes, we compared the mRNAs and the genomic DNA sequences coding for the synthesis of two pairs of serologically related variant-specific antigens (VSAs) of trypanosomes: AnTat 1.1 and AnTat 1.1b, both from the strain 1125 of T.b.brucei and AnTat 1.8 and LiTat 1.6 from T.b.brucei and T.b. gambiense, respectively. Within each pair, large similarities were observed in the coding sequence, except in the 3' region which appears to be highly variable. However, a low level of cross-hybridization can be detected between all sequences, in the 3' region only. The expression of these VSAs is linked to a similar duplication-transposition mechanism. The insertion locus of the transposition unit is the same both in AnTat 1.1 and AnTat 1.1b DNAs. In both pairs, the transposition unit seems to comprise at least about 200 bp upstream of the 5' extremity of the coding sequence. The significance of these results, regarding the structure and synthesis of the VSAs, is discussed.Images"
186,1981,Analysis of transcription of the human Alu family ubiquitous repeating element by eukaryotic RNA polymerase III.,"A series of clones that contain human Alu family elements are actively transcribed in soluble in vitro RNA polymerase III systems. The 5' ends of the in vitro transcripts are located about 170 nucleotides upstream of the eponymous Alu I site of the repeat, while a region associated with specifying of the initiation site for in vitro transcription lies in the region between 79 and 106 nucleotides upstream of the central Alu site. Thus, the RNA polymerase III transcription unit defined by the human Alu family is similar to other RNA polymerase III transcription units in possessing an internal region that is required for active transcription in vitro.Images"
187,1981,Analytical approaches to the study of the disposition of myelotoxic agents.,"A correlation of myelotoxic effect with concentration or a foreign compound of its metabolite at the site of action may provide useful insights into the mechanism of toxic action and/or its amelioration. This correlation requires sensitive and specific assay methods. This communication describes useful methods for the study of benzene disposition in rodents. The assays are sensitive, specific, and rapid. They rely on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and on high performance liquid chromatography. These methods have allowed measurement of catechol, phenol, and hydroquinone in samples of rodent bone marrow following inhalation exposure to benzene. Their application to the study of benzene metabolism in rat bone marrow in situ is also described."

190,1981,An autoradiographic demonstration of nuclear DNA replication by DNA polymerase alpha and of mitochondrial DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase gamma.,"The incorporation of thymidine into the DNA of eukaryotic cells is markedly depressed, but not completely inhibited, by aphidicolin, a highly specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha. An electron microscope autoradiographic analysis of the synthesis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in vivo in Concanavalin A stimulated rabbit spleen lymphocytes and in Hamster cell cultures, in the absence and in the presence of aphidicolin, revealed that aphidicolin inhibits the nuclear but not the mitochondrial DNA replication. We therefore conclude that DNA polymerase alpha performs the synchronous bidirectional replication of nuclear DNA and that DNA polymerase gamma, the only DNA polymerase present in the mitochondria, performs the ""strand displacement"" DNA synthesis of these organelles.Images"

194,1981,An experimental approach to enumerate the genes coding for immunoglobulin variable-regions.,"Critical to our understanding of the immune system diversity is the determination of the number of germ line V genes. The total number of V genes is given by the product: number of subgroups x number of germ line genes per subgroup. Studies of kappa chains and of embryonic DNA indicate 5-10 V genes per subgroup. Statistical analysis of the limited sequence data of mouse kappa chains suggest about 50 V kappa subgroups. We report here a general approach for direct estimation of the number of VL and VH subgroups expressed in normal spleen, and present data for V kappa. The kappa mRNA of the spleen is a heterogeneous population where different V kappa are linked to the same C kappa, i.e. C kappa equals total V kappa. The ratio C kappa/distinct V kappa approximates the number of subgroups since V kappa of the same subgroup cross hybridize while V kappa of different subgroups do not. This ratio was determined by molecular hybridization of cloned C kappa and V kappa DNA probes with spleen mRNA. The results indicate the expression of 280 V kappa subgroups in mouse. Assuming an average of 7 genes per subgroup, we estimate about 2000 V kappa germ line genes.Images"
195,1981,Angiosarcoma of the liver: a signal lesion of vinyl chloride exposure.,"Vinyl chloride (VCM) induced angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL) is a rare vascular tumor which might be associated with a wide range of disease states. The possibility that this tumor might be a signal lesion is supported by mortality studies suggesting that cancers of the digestive, respiratory, neurological and lymphatic systems have occurred more often than expected in VCM workers. There is also evidence that certain non-neoplastic disorders, such as pneumoconiosis and excess fetal deaths, may be associated with this chemical. It has been suggested that a gradual increase in the incidence of ASL might have occurred in recent years. This could be a reflection of the long latency period and/or the increased recognition of this entity. Several cases of ASL have occurred in people living in the vicinity of VCM plants. This raises the possibility that low-level exposure to this chemical over a long period might induce ASL."
196,1981,An improved procedure for utilizing terminal transferase to add homopolymers to the 3' termini of DNA.,"Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (E.C.2.7.7.3.1.) from calf thymus was used to add homopolymer tails to duplex DNA with 3' protruding, even, or 3' recessive ends. A gel electrophoresis method was employed to analyze the tail length and the percent of DNA with tails. In all the tailing reactions, dA, dT, and dC tails from CoCl2-containing buffer were longer than those from MnCl2 - or MgCl2 - containing buffers, whereas dG tails from MnCl2 -containing buffer were the longest. By varying the ratio of dNTP over DNA terminus and the concentration of terminal transferase, optimal conditions were found for adding dG or dC tails of 10-25 nucleotides in length and dA and dT tails of 20-40 nucleotides in length to duplex DNA with all types of 3' termini.Images"
197,1981,An intron nucleotide sequence variant in a cloned beta +-thalassaemia globin gene.,A 7.5 kb Hsu I restriction fragment of genomic DNA containing a beta-globin gene has been isolated from a patient doubly heterozygous for beta + thalassaemia and a delta beta (Lepore globin fusion gene. This fragment must be derived from the chromosome carrying the beta +-thalassaemia determinant. The gross structure of the cloned gene plus flanking sequences is indistinguishable from that of a normal beta-globin gene. Within in 1606 base-pair transcribed region of the gene there is only one nucleotide difference from the normal beta-globin gene sequence. This is a G leads to A replacement 21 nucleotides upstream from the 3' terminus of the small intron. This nucleotide lies within a 10 base-pair sequence repeated in an inverted configuration near the 5' terminus of the small intron. The nucleotide replacement may result in a precursor mRNA less amenable to RNA splicing than its normal counterpart.Images
198,1981,A novel rearrangement of the human ë_-like globin gene cluster,The first example of a duplication involving the human ë_-like globin genes has been characterised in DNA from a native of Vanuatu. Restriction endonuclease mapping has shown that a 5 kb insert of DNA in the ë_-ë«-ë_ gene cluster is due to duplication of the Gë_-globin gene and results in a new rearrangement 5‰Û_-ëµ-Gë_-Gë_-Aë_-ë«-ë_-3‰Û_.Images
199,1981,Anthramycin inhibition of restriction endonuclease cleavage and its use as a reversible blocking agent in DNA constructions.,"Anthramycin can form a stable complex with DNA which does not dissociate upon repeated ethanol precipitations. The complex forms in less than one hour at pH 5.5. Bound anthramycin seems to be located in the minor groove of the DNA helix in the anthramycin DNA complex, since methylation of adenosine residues at N-3 by dimethylsulfate is reduced. The anthramycin-DNA complex is resistant to digestion by an excess of a number of restriction enzymes. Anthramycin can be removed from DNA by incubation at acid pH. The released DNA can then be cleaved by restriction enzymes. Anthramycin-DNA complexes can be acted upon by T4 polynucleotide ligase to form longer DNA molecules. The ability of anthramycin to form a stable but reversible complex which is not cleaved by restriction enzymes but can engage in joining reactions may allow a wider variety of DNA fragments to be more readily constructed in vitro.Images"
200,1981,Antiviral activities of hybrids of two major human leukocyte interferons.,"Four hybrid human leukocyte interferon (LeIF or IFN-alpha) genes have been constructed by in vitro recombination of LeIF-A (IFN-alpha 2) and LeIF-D (IFN-alpha 1) genes at common restriction endonuclease sites located within their coding regions. These hybrid genes have been expressed in E. coli under trp promoter control. The interferons produced [LeIF-AD (BglII), -AD (PvuII), -DA (BglII), -DA (PvuII)] have antiviral properties distinct from the parental molecules LeIF-A and -D, varying considerably in their abilities to inhibit plaque formation by different viruses in a range of mammalian cells. All six of the cloned LeIFs exhibit the heat stability, pH 2 stability and antigenic specificity of natural leukocyte interferons."
201,1982,13C NMR relaxation and conformational flexibility of the deoxyribose ring.,"13C T1's and NOE's have been measured for all protonated carbons of 2'-deoxy-D-ribose (2'-d-ribose), 2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-dAMP), thymidine-3'-monophosphate (3'-TMP) and thymidine-5'-monophosphate (5'-TMP) in D2O solutions. In all of the deoxy sugars examined, NT1 values for C-2' are significantly larger than the values for the remaining carbons. This result is interpreted in terms of rapid puckering motion of C-2'. By contrast, NT1 values measured in ribose are found to be equal, within experimental error. The results are compared with analogous data obtained for the five membered pyrrolidine ring of proline and with results for DNA itself."
202,1982,3'-Terminal sequence of wheat mitochondrial 18S ribosomal RNA: further evidence of a eubacterial evolutionary origin.,"We have determined the sequences of the 3'-terminal approximately 100 nucleotides of [5' -32P]pCp-labeled wheat mitochondrial, wheat cytosol, and E. coli small sub-unit rRNAs. Sequence comparison demonstrates that within this region, there is a substantially greater degree of homology between wheat mitochondrial 18S and E. coli 16S rRNAs than between either of these and wheat cytosol 18S rRNA. Moreover, at a position occupied by 3-methyluridine in E. coli 16S rRNA, the same (or a very similar) modified nucleoside is present in wheat mitochondrial 18S rRNA but not in wheat cytosol 18S rRNA. Further, E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs hybridize extensively to wheat mitochondrial 18S and 26S rRNA genes, respectively, but wheat cytosol 18S and 26S rRNAs do not. No other mitochondrial system studies to date has provided comparable evidence that a mitochondrial rRNA is more closely related to its eubacterial homolog than is its counterpart in the cytoplasmic compartment of the same cell. The results reported here provide additional support for the view that plant mitochondria are of endosymbiotic, specifically eubacterial, origin.Images"
203,1982,"5,6-Saturated thymine lesions in DNA: production by ultraviolet light or hydrogen peroxide.","Thymine analogs with saturated 5-6 bonds are important types of DNA damage that are recognized by the DNA N-glycosylase activity of E. coli endonuclease III. Seeking agents which could preferentially form 5,6-hydrated thymine residues in duplex DNA both in vivo and in vitro, we exposed purified duplex DNA to 325- or 313-nm light; however, after such exposure pyrimidine dimers greatly predominated over 5,6-hydrated thymine. Hydrogen peroxide, on the other hand, formed significant numbers of endonuclease III-sensitive sites in vitro which were not apurinic/apyrimidinic lesions and thus were likely to be 5,6-hydrated thymines."
204,1982,5S RNA sequence from the Philosamia silkworm: evidence for variable evolutionary rates in insect 5S RNA.,"The primary structure of 5S RNA isolated from the posterior silkgland of Philosamia cynthia ricini was determined using three in vitro labelling techniques. The derived sequence consists of 119 nucleotides and can be folded into the secondary structure model proposed for eukaryotic 5S RNAs. This 5S RNA differs from the Bombyx mori molecule in 9 positions and from the Drosophila melanogaster sequence in 14 positions. The comparison of evolutionary rates in insect 5S RNA with inferred rates in other eukaryotic phyla leads to the conclusion that 5S RNA evolution is not constant in different eukaryotic branches, a condition which must be taken into account in phylogenetic tree constructions.Images"
205,1982,A 3' co-terminus of two early herpes simplex virus type 1 mRNAs.,"A 3' co-terminus of two early herpes simplex virus type 1 mRNAs has been identified using the nuclease -S1 mapping procedure with cloned virus DNA probes. These mRNAs (5.0 kb and 1.2 kb), located within the genome region 0.56-0.60, are unspliced and are transcribed rightwards on the prototype genome orientation. The position of their 3' ends has been located on the virus DNA sequence and lies downstream from the polyadenylation signal 5'-AATAAA-3'. This hexanucleotide sequence also was present in the complementary DNA strand and was shown to be the polyadenylation signal for a leftwards-transcribed late mRNA. The abundance within the cytoplasm of the 5.0 kb and 1.2 kb mRNAs was investigated. Results indicated that these mRNAs were regulated in concert. It is suggested that sequences at the 3' co-terminus may be involved in their regulation.Images"

210,1982,A carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance study of the 3'-terminus of 16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli specifically labeled with carbon-13 in the methylgroups of the m6(2)Am6(2)A sequence.,"30S ribosomes were isolated from a kasugamycin resistant mutant of E. coli that lacks methylgroups on two adjacent adenines in 16S ribosomal RNA. These ribosomes were methylated in vitro with a purified methylating enzyme and 5-S-adenosyl-(13C-methyl)-L-methionine chloride ((13C-methyl)-SAM) as methyldonor. After in situ cleavage of the 16S ribosomal RNA by the bacteriocin cloacin DF13, the 49 nucleotide fragment from the 3'-end of the RNA was isolated. The carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the fragment at various temperatures were compared with those of 6-N-dimethyladenosine (m6(2)A) and 6-N-dimethyladenylyl-(3' leads to 5')-6-N-dimethyladenosine (m6(2)Am6(2)A). The data show that the two methylated adenines, which are part of a four membered hairpin loop, show a strong tendency to be stacked in analogy to the dinucleotide m6(2)Am6(2)."
211,1982,A catalogue of splice junction sequences.,Splice junction sequences from a large number of nuclear and viral genes encoding protein have been collected. The sequence CAAG/GTAGAGT was found to be a consensus of 139 exon-intron boundaries (or donor sequences) and (TC)nNCTAG/G was found to be a consensus of 130 intron-exon boundaries (or acceptor sequences). The possible role of splice junction sequences as signals for processing is discussed.
212,1982,Accessibility of U1 RNA to base pairing with a single-stranded DNA fragment mimicking the intron extremities at the splice junction.,"A DNA fragment containing a 16 nucleotide sequence mimicking the intron extremities of premessenger RNA aligned as proposed previously (1,2) in a model of splicing mechanism was prepared and used as a probe for accessibility of the 5' extremity of U1 RNA. Hybridization of U1 RNA to the probe under non denaturing conditions and digestion of the hybrid with RNase H revealed that the sequence of U1 RNA which is complementary to the extremities of introns is accessible to hybridization and to enzymes. Therefore, the configuration of isolated U1 RNA satisfies the criteria required for the alignment of introns and further enzymatic reactions of splicing.Images"
213,1982,Accurate in vitro splicing of human beta-globin RNA.,"Human beta-globin RNA transcribed from an exogenous DNA template is spliced in vitro by concentrated whole cell extracts from HeLa cells. Using the primer extension technique, we have shown that the small intervening sequence is spliced accurately and that the sequence of the product across the splice junction is identical to that of beta-globin mRNA prepared from human reticulocytes. The efficiency of the splicing reaction is low. The RNA transcript containing both introns and terminated upstream from the polyadenylation site is spliced most efficiently. The transcript which is terminated downstream from the polyadenylation site is not spliced at all. Thalassemic beta-globin RNA which carries an extra splice site in the small intron is also spliced, albeit with a low yield.Images"
214,1982,Accurate transcription of cloned Xenopus rRNA genes by RNA polymerase I: demonstration by S1 nuclease mapping.,"We have demonstrated faithful transcriptional initiation of cloned Xenopus rRNA genes upon injection into Xenopus oocytes. This observation has been made possible by the use of an S1 nuclease assay that is both sensitive and quantitative. In order to detect rRNA synthesis from the injected template above the large background of rRNA endogenously present in oocytes, the divergence of ribosomal DNA sequences between two Xenopus species was utilized. Cloned X. laevis ribosomal DNA was injected into the nuclei of X. borealis oocytes. Total oocyte RNA was then isolated and hybridized to a radioactive DNA probe that over laps the 5' end of X. laevis rRNA; endogenous rRNA of the X. borealis oocytes does not hybridize to the probe. RNA/DNA hybrids were treated with S1 nuclease and protected fragments were sized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNA made from the injected rDNA protects the same region of probe as does authentic X. laevis precursor rRNA. Thus, transcription appears to initiate on the cloned, microinjected X. laevis rDNA at the same site as is used in vivo. This synthesis is not impaired by coinjection of an amount of alpha-amanitin sufficient to inhibit RNA polymerase II and III; therefore the reaction is mediated by RNA polymerase I. The amount of transcription may be reproducibly quantitated and we have varied a number of parameters in order to maximize transcriptional expression of the injected rDNA. Eight independently isolated X. laevis rDNA clones as well as several subcloned initiation regions of these genes are all accurately transcribed at approximately equal efficiency. This assay should facilitate analysis of several aspects of rRNA transcription, including deleniation of the Xenopus RNA polymerase I promoter location.Images"
215,1982,A cloned immunoglobulin cDNA fragment enhances transposition of IS elements into recombinant plasmids.,"Evidence is presented indicating that a novel DNA sequence arrangement generated by in vitro recombination may elicit high frequency transpositions of IS elements. A 109 bp Bam HI fragment of the cDNA for the immunoglobulin kappa light chain from MOPC 321 myeloma was cloned into the Bam HI site of pBR313. The cloned fragment extends from the codon for Gly 57 to the V-J junction. Insertions of IS1 or IS5 were identified in 6 of 50 plasmid DNAs isolated from freshly transformed clones. Additional transposition events were detected after subculturing for several growth cycles. Three independent insertions of IS1 occurred in the promoter region of the TcR operon. All IS5 and the remaining IS1 insertions were located in the TcR region upstream to the cloned DNA sequence. Sequences homologous to the ends of IS1, or corresponding to the consensus sequence at the target site of IS5 are present near the estimated sites of insertion of IS1 or IS5 respectively. Bacteria harboring recombinant plasmids carrying the cloned DNA in either orientation grew at a reduced rate relative to cells harboring pBR313, suggesting that fused gene products made from the two types of plasmid were inhibitory to cell growth. IS insertions, which relieved this inhibitory effect and thereby provided a selective advantage, were found exclusively in plasmids carrying the cloned DNA in only one of the two orientations. The fact that IS elements were not observed in the other type of recombinant plasmid indicates that selective pressure alone is not sufficient to account for the frequent IS insertions observed and that sequences at a distance from the site of IS insertion may be critical in the regulation of transposition frequency.Images"

Electron-microscopic maps corresponding to five points of the melting curve of RF III were obtained and compared with the theoretical melting maps obtained in (4) and (6). This comparison clearly shows that only rigorous calculations (4) and not the ones proposed by Azbel (6,7) correctly predict the course of RF III melting.Images"
218,1982,A comparison of nucleoside (beta-S)triphosphates and nucleoside (gamma-S)triphosphates as suitable substrates for measuring transcription initiation in preparations of cell nuclei.,"RNA chains initiated with nucleoside (beta-S)triphosphates and (gamma-S)triphosphates retain the thiol groups and can be separated from thiol-free RNA by chromatography on mercury-Sepharose. Thiol-containing mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA synthesized by preparations of nuclei from virus-infected cells was quantitated by nucleic acid filter hybridization. With ATP beta S and GTP beta S, region-specific initiation of MMTV RNA chains was detected in the cell free system. However, with ATP gamma S and GTP gamma S, region-specific initiation was not clearly demonstrable. The nuclear preparations can also transfer thiol groups, presumably in the form of thiophosphate, from ATP gamma S or GTP gamma S onto preexisting RNA molecules; little or no thiol-transfer occurs with the two (beta-S)-analogues. The thiophosphate transfer activity apparently interferes with the measurement of RNA chain initiation with ATP gamma S and GTP gamma S."
219,1982,A convenient and adaptable package of DNA sequence analysis programs for microcomputers.,"We describe a package of DNA data handling and analysis programs designed for microcomputers. The package is convenient for immediate use by persons with little or no computer experience, and has been optimized by trial in our group for a year. By typing a single command, the user enters a system which asks questions or gives instructions in English. The system will enter, alter, and manage sequence files or a restriction enzyme library. It generates the reverse complement, translates, calculates codon usage, finds restriction sites, finds homologies with various degrees of mismatch, and graphs amino acid composition or base frequencies. A number of options for data handling and printing can be used to produce figures for publication. The package will be available in ANSI Standard FORTRAN for use with virtually any FORTRAN compiler."
220,1982,A critical analysis of a left-handed double helix model for B-DNA fibers.,A search for a left-handed double helix model for B-DNA fibers has been undertaken. The model has to present good stereochemistry and also to be in agreement with X-ray and infrared data. Dihedral angles as well as atomic coordinates and calculated intensities curves are given for the best model obtained. Comparison with experimental results shows that this model must be rejected as a candidate for the representation of B-DNA fibers.
221,1982,Activation of vitellogenin gene transcription is a direct response to estrogen in Xenopus laevis liver.,"Estrogen induces the synthesis of vitellogenin mRNA by activating transcription of the vitellogenin genes. Quantitative inhibition of liver protein synthesis by cycloheximide does not prevent activation of vitellogenin gene transcription. The relative transcription rate of the vitellogenin genes in estrogen stimulated liver is similar in control and cycloheximide treated animals (800-1000 ppm). Selective estrogen activation of vitellogenin gene transcription therefore represents a direct effect of estrogen on vitellogenin gene transcription which can occur without any change in the cells' protein complement. Two other cellular responses to estrogen, the induction of nuclear estrogen receptor, and an increased rate of total nuclear RNA synthesis, are blocked by cycloheximide administration. Since the overall rate of vitellogenin mRNA synthesis is a function of both the selective estrogen activation of vitellogenin gene transcription which is not blocked by cycloheximide and the increased rate of total nuclear RNA synthesis which is blocked by cycloheximide, the total rate of vitellogenin mRNA synthesis is markedly reduced following cycloheximide administration."
222,1982,Activities of the Environmental Protection Agency concerning phthalate esters,"EPA's activities concerning phthalate esters have been in four general areas, namely: (1) their status as toxic pollutants under the Clean Water Act; (2) their status as ‰ÛÏnew chemicals‰Û under Section 5 of TSCA; (3) the potential risk to human beings posed by DEHP; and (4) finally, the need for testing phthalates with respect to their health and environmental effects."
223,1982,Adaptive increase of O6-methylguanine-acceptor protein in HeLa cells following N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treatment.,"We have assayed in extracts of HeLa cells the amount of acceptor protein that removes O6-methylguanine adducts from alkylated DNA. Cells were treated with single or multiple nontoxic doses of N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and the extracts were analyzed up to 32 h after the last exposure. The acceptor activity assayed immediately (1 h) after single exposures decreases linearly with dose indicating that the acceptor protein is used up by endogenous O6-methylguanine adducts in a stoichiometric reaction. Multiple exposures, assayed 8-24 h after the last exposure, increase the amount of acceptor protein in a dose dependent fashion followed by a decrease above a cumulative dose of 100 ng/ml. Under conditions of maximum induction, there are about 300,000 acceptor protein sites per cell, approximately 3 fold above the constitutive level. Both in adapted and unadapted cells the methyl group from O6-methylguanine adducts in the alkylated DNA is transferred to cysteine residues of the acceptor protein(s)."
224,1982,Adenine-guanine base pairing ribosomal RNA.,"Analyses of secondary structures proposed for ribosomal RNA's show that, of the different kinds of base pairs directly adjoining the ends of postulated double-helical regions, only A-G with A at the 5' end significantly exceeds the number expected for a random base distribution. An A(syn)-G(trans) hydrogen-bonded basepair is proposed. This could fit at the end of an undistorted double helix, but would prevent further base stacking, thus favoring a break in the double helix to produce a non-linear tertiary structure."

At least one of these repeated elements is homologous to regions of rDNA. Restriction analysis of the clone shows that some of the repeated elements are present as tandem duplications and in scattered locations within the cloned DNA segment. There are also three non-ribosomal protein genes contained in this clone, each of which is expressed along with the ribosomal protein gene into RNA species present in Drosophila embryos.Images"
228,1982,A flexible new computer program for handling DNA sequence data.,"A compact new computer program for handling nucleic acid sequence data is presented. It consists of a number of different subsets, which may be used according to a given code system.

The program is especially designed for detection of overlapping genes. The language, is FORTRAN and thus the program may be used on small computers; it may also be used without any prior computer experience. Copies are available on request."
229,1982,A generalized method of subcloning DNA fragments by restriction site reconstruction: application to sequencing the amino-terminal coding region of the transforming gene of Gazdar murine sarcoma virus.,"The technique of restriction site reconstruction was generalized so as to allow the subcloning of any DNA fragment and its subsequent reexcision with EcoRI, XbaI, XhoI or HindIII. After excision, the 3' terminus of each strand will be derived from the starting nucleic acid, permitting the use of such fragments as primers for nucleotide sequencing by primer extension methods. The technique was used to subclone a 56 base pair BstNI-DdeI fragment of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV) as a unique HindIII-HindIII fragment. This fragment then served as a primer to sequence a portion of the RNA genome of Gazdar murine sarcoma virus (Gz-MSV). The nucleotide sequence which was obtained indicated that the transforming gene of Gz-MSV arose by at least two recombination events involving murine leukemia virus (MLV) and the cellular homologue c-mos. This analysis suggests that a virus indistinguishable from Mo-MSV was an intermediate in the formation of Gz-MSV.Images"
230,1982,A general method for the synthesis of 5'-monophosphates of DNA fragments via phosphotriester intermediates.,"A new and attractive phosphorylation procedure which allows the introduction, via phosphotriester intermediates, of 5'-phosphate functions of DNA fragments is described. The method is based on the activation of bifunctional phosphorylating agents with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. The approach will be exemplified by the synthesis of pACGC using four different 5'-phosphotriester intermediates."
231,1982,A general strategy for cloning double-stranded RNA: nucleotide sequence of the Simian-11 rotavirus gene 8.,"Using Simian-11 rotavirus RNA, a strategy has been developed for the production of full length cloned copies of the genes of double-stranded (dsRNA) viruses. Genomic RNA segments were polyadenylated and reverse transcribed to yield a mixture of full length cDNA copies of both possible polarities. The cDNAs were annealed, filled in to complete any partial copies, tailed and inserted into the PstI site of pBR322 using dG/dC tailing. Cloned rotavirus cDNA gene copies were assigned to genomic RNA segments by Northern hybridization. The complete sequence of gene 8 which codes for NCVP3, a non-structural protein of SA11 rotavirus, was determined from a cloned gene copy. It is 1059 bases in length and has an open reading frame which could code for a protein containing 317 amino acids. The apparent 5' and 3' terminal non coding regions are 46 and 59 bases in length, respectively. The sequence ATGTGACCOH at the 3' end of the plus strand is conserved in four of the eleven genes examined. The cloning procedures used should be generally applicable to viruses with segmented dsRNA genomes.Images"
232,1982,"A high speed, high capacity homology matrix: zooming through SV40 and polyoma.","We present a new homology matrix program which owes its basic conception to the two-dimensional dot matrices previously described (1,2), but has important improvements and new features. It scores sequence homology over an adjustable range and plots the scores which are above an operator-determined filtration level. Its powerful noise-filtration system, capacity for compression without much loss of information, and speed of execution make this program a valuable tool in the analysis of homologies, internal direct repeats and reverse repeats, including palindromic sequences. The properties of the program are exemplified by analysis of SV40 and polyoma DNA sequences."

The mutation, named M42, is a two base pair insertion that changes the distance between the -10 and -35 regions from 18 to 20 residues. The activity of the mutant promotor measured in vivo is 15% of the wild-type promotor. The M42 promotor is sensitive to the catabolite repression in the manner similar to that of the wild type. Sequences of several deletions within the lac promotor are also given.Images"
235,1982,A large database DNA sequence handling program with generalized searching specifications.,"The program described allows for the creation and manipulation of files of DNA sequence data up to very great lengths. The program uses its own paging system to load segments of the sequence into a small internal buffer so that the program does not have excessive memory requirements. The program offers a menu of functions to the user, and has been written to be forgiving of user errors. A code for the generalised specification of bases as a series of groups (i.e. A or T, Purine, etc.) has been devised and can be used in search specifications or in sequence files. Versions of the program have been developed to run with special efficiency under DIGITAL's RT11 operating system or to run under systems with a suitable implementation of FORTRAN VI."
236,1982,Alignment of nucleosomes along DNA and organization of spacer DNA in Drosophila chromatin.,"A series of mono- and dinucleosomal DNAs characterized by an about ten-base periodicity in the size were revealed in the micrococcal nuclease digests of Drosophila chromatin which have 180 +/- 5 base pair (bp) nucleosomal repeat. 20, 30, and 40 bp spacers were found to be predominant in chromatin by trimming DNA in dinucleosomes to the core position. Among several identified mononucleosomes (MN), MN170, MN180 and MN190 were isolated from different sources (the figures indicate the DNA length in bp). The presence of the 10, 20, and 30 bp long spacers was shown in these mononucleosomes by crosslinking experiments. The interaction of histone H3 with the spacer in the Drosophila MN180 particle was also shown by the crosslinking /5/. We conclude from these results that the 10 n bp long intercore DNA (n = 2, 3 and 4) is organized by histone H3, in particular, and together with the core DNA forms a continuous superhelix. Taken together, these data suggest that Drosophila chromatin consists of the regularly aligned and tightly packed MN180, as a repeating unit, containing 10 and 20 bp spacers at the ends of 180 bp DNA. Within the asymmetric and randomly oriented in chromatin MN180, the cores occupy two alternative positions spaced by 10 bp.Images"
237,1982,Alterations in nerve and muscle compound action potentials after acute acrylamide administration.,"The early deficits of neurotoxicity induced by acrylamide were examined in rats by comparing nerve and muscle action potentials before and 24 hr after exposure to acrylamide (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg). No changes were seen in the nerve action potential amplitude or duration. The 25 mg/kg dose produced a more variable nerve conduction velocity. There was also a significant broadening of the muscle compound action potential. Neither of these effects were seen in the fasted controls. However, the lengthening of the relative refractory period of the muscle action potential was highly correlated with losses in body weight in the treatment groups and was identical to changes seen in control animals which were fasted for 24 hr. The slowed conduction of the muscle action potential may be a precursor of the nerve terminal damage which results from chronic exposure. Changes in the muscle refractory period, on the other hand, appear to be secondary to the loss in body weight which accompanies acrylamide administration."
238,1982,A mercury-thiol affinity system for rapid generation of overlapping labeled DNA fragments for DNA sequencing.,"We describe an in vitro protocol for quickly generating overlapping terminal-labeled restriction fragments for DNA sequence analysis via the Maxam-Gilbert technique. The protocol involves introducing mercurated nucleotides into one end of a region to be sequenced, partial digestion with several restriction enzymes and terminal-labeling, separation of the mercurated restriction enzymes and terminal-labeling, separation of the mercurated restriction fragments from non-mercurated ones on a thiol column and resolution of the different mercurated fragments on one preparative agarose gel. The protocol was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of a 980 base pair cDNA that contains the coding region for a variable surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei. It could just as quickly and easily be used to obtain many terminal-labeled overlapping restriction fragments covering a region of several kilobases.Images"
239,1982,A microcomputer program for analysis of nucleic acid hybridization data,"The study of nucleic acid hybridization is facilitated by computer mediated fitting of theoretical models to experimental data. This paper describes a non-linear curve fitting program, using the `Patternsearch' algorithm, written in BASIC for the Apple II microcomputer. The advantages and disadvantages of using a microcomputer for local data processing are discussed. Images"
240,1982,Amount and distribution of 5-methylcytosine in human DNA from different types of tissues of cells.,"Analysis of the total base composition of DNA from seven different normal human tissues and eight different types of homogeneous human cell populations revealed considerable tissue-specific and cell-specific differences in the extent of methylation of cytosine residues. The two most highly methylated DNAs were from thymus and brain with 1.00 and 0.98 mole percent 5-methylcytosine (m5C), respectively. The two least methylated DNAs from in vivo sources were placental DNA and sperm DNA, which had 0.76 and 0.84 mole percent m5C, respectively. The differences between these two groups of samples were significant with p less than 0.01. The m5C content of DNA from six human cell lines or strains ranged from 0.57 to 0.85 mole percent. The major and minor base composition of DNA fractionated by reassociation kinetics was also determined. The distribution of m5C among these fractions showed little or no variation with tissue or cell type with the possible exception of sperm DNA. In each case, nonrepetitive DNA sequences were hypomethylated compared to unfractionated DNA."
241,1982,An adenovirus agnogene.,"The nucleotide sequence of a 550 base pairs long segment, located between map positions 21 and 22.5 in the adenovirus type 2 genome has been determined. S1 nuclease mapping and sequence analysis of cDNA copies of adenovirus mRNA demonstrated that the established sequence includes the i-leader which is spliced to the 5'-end of certain adenovirus mRNAs (1). The i-leader which is 440 nucleotides long contains an open translational reading frame which is preceded by an AUG triplet and which terminates in the third segment of the tripartite leader. A polypeptide with the same molecular weight as predicted from the DNA sequence was identified by in vitro translation of mRNA which had been selected by hybridization to DNA fragments, containing sequences from the i-leader. The results thus suggest that the i-leader, unlike other adenovirus leader segments, is used for translation.Images"
242,1982,An algorithm for the display of nucleic acid secondary structure.,"A simple algorithm is presented for the graphic display of nucleic acid secondary structure. Examples of secondary structure displays are given for tRNA, 5S RNA and part of the 16S RNA. Due to its speed, this algorithm could easily be used in conjunction with secondary structure programs which calculate various alternate structures."
243,1982,Analogous cleavage of DNA by micrococcal nuclease and a 1-10-phenanthroline-cuprous complex.,"We have examined the DNA cleavage specificity of a 1,10-phenanthroline-cuprous complex and find this agent to recognize the same sites and cleave with the same relative preferences as micrococcal nuclease. In contrast, DNase I and bleomycin-ferrous complex cleave the same 5000 bp D. melanogaster histone gene DNA with different specificities, although some of the sites appear to be recognized and cleaved by all four reagents. Our results suggest that the reagents used probably detect discrete conformational perturbations along the DNA double helix.Images"
244,1982,"Analysis of chromatin structure and DNA sequence organization: use of the 1,10-phenanthroline-cuprous complex.","Limited treatment of Drosophila nuclei with the 1,10-phenanthroline-cuprous complex leads to rapid production of nucleosomal ladders indistinguishable from those obtained by micrococcal nuclease digestion. An investigation of the preferential sites of cleavage of protein-free DNA at locus 67B1 surprisingly indicated that both reagents recognized very similar features. Thus, a virtually identical pattern of preferential cleavages was generated over a 12 kb fragment encoding four transcripts at this locus. The distribution of cleavage sites was highly non-random, with major sites falling in the spacers between the genes. Both reagents cleaved certain chromatin-specific sites near the 5' ends of the genes. However, an analysis of preferential cleavages at the sequence level did not reveal the same close correspondence. We suggest that both reagents can recognize some localized secondary structural features of the DNA and that the particular distribution of sequences present at this locus results in a distinctive pattern of cleavage sites that delineates gene and spacer segments.Images"
245,1982,Analysis of difference spectra of protonated DNA: determination of degree of protonation of nitrogen bases and the fractions of disordered nucleotide pairs.,"The titration curves of nitrogen bases and fractions of disordered nucleotide pairs are obtained during DNA protonation. It is shown that purine bases are the first sites of the DNA double helix protonation. The cytosine protonation is due to proton-induced conformational transition within GC pairs with the sequence proton transfer from (N-7) of guanine to (N-3) of cytosine. Within DNA with unwound regions the bases are protonated in the following order: cytosine, adenine, guanine. It is shown that GC pairs are the primary centres in which the unwinding of protonated DNAs occurs."
246,1982,analysis of genomic rearrangements associated with two variable antigen genes of Trypanosoma brucei.,"Some variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes of Trypanosoma brucei undergo duplication and transposition when they are expressed. We report here the cloning of cDNAs coding for two VSGs from the ILtar 1 repertoire. Analysis of the genomes of trypanosomes expressing these and other antigens shows that there is no additional copy of the sequences coding for eight VSG in expressing clones of trypanosomes, and reveals rearrangements analogous to those previously described for the gene for another VSG from this antigen repertoire. The data indicate that duplication does not accompany the expression of these VSG genes. Transposition to a specific expression site cannot be excluded, but would have to involve either a much larger segment of DNA, or movement to a region of much greater homology with the previous flanking sequences, than is observed for VSG genes that are duplicated when expressed. It is reasoned that the control of expression by coupled duplication and transposition is not sufficient to account for the selection of a single VSG gene for expression.Images"
247,1982,Analysis of highly purified satellite DNA containing chromatin from the mouse.,"A purification scheme for satellite DNA containing chromatin from mouse liver has been developed. It is based on the highly condensed state of the satellite chromatin and also takes advantage of its resistance to digestion by certain restriction nucleases. Nuclei are first treated with micrococcal nuclease and the satellite chromatin enriched 3-5 fold by extraction of the digested nuclei under appropriate conditions. Further purification is achieved by digestion of the chromatin with a restriction nuclease that leaves satellite DNA largely intact but degrades non-satellite DNA extensively. In subsequent sucrose gradient centrifugation the rapidly sedimenting chromatin contains more than 70% satellite DNA. This material has the same histone composition as bulk chromatin. No significant differences were detected in an analysis of minor histone variants. Nonhistone proteins are present only in very low amounts in the satellite chromatin fraction, notably the HMG proteins are strongly depleted.Images"
248,1982,Analysis of tet operator-TET repressor complexes by thermal denaturation studies.,Interaction of the Tn10 encoded TET repressor with the tet operator is studied by thermal denaturation of the specific complexes employing operator containing purified DNA restriction fragments varying in length from 187 bp to 501 bp. Comparison of the melting curves obtained with the free DNA and DNA.repressor complexes revealed a specific stabilisation of the operator containing cooperatively melting segment in multiphasic denaturation curves. Under limiting concentrations of TET repressor the denaturation of the free DNA is observed next to the denaturation of the repressor.DNA complex. Quantitative analysis yields a binding curve with a stoichiometry of four TET repressors per tet operator containing fragment. The denaturation temperature of the complex is almost independent of the ionic strength indicating that the protein component denatures at this temperature. The half life time of the TET repressor.tet operator complex is greater than 100 min under these conditions. The tet operator on the 187 bp fragment is determined to be located between a Xba I and a Sau 3a site by removing base pairs from either end of the fragment and subsequent comparison of the melting curves. It is concluded that the TET repressor recognizes the double stranded rather than a possible cruciform structure of the tet operator. The influence of a regulatory protein on the thermal stability of a genetic control region is discussed with respect to its possible influence on the initiation of transcription.

250,1982,An analysis of cosmid clones of nuclear DNA from Trypanosoma brucei shows that the genes for variant surface glycoproteins are clustered in the genome.,"Trypanosoma brucei contains more than a hundred genes coding for the different variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs). Activation of some of these genes involves the duplication of the gene (the basic copy or BC) and transposition of the duplicate to an expression site (yielding the expression-linked copy or ELC). We have cloned large fragments of genomic DNA in cosmid vectors in Escherichia coli. Cosmids containing the BCs of genes 117, 118 and 121 were readily obtained, but DNA containing the ELCs was strongly selected against in the cosmid and plasmid cloning systems used. We have analysed the distribution of VSG genes in the genome using probes for the sequences at the edges of the transposed segment which are partially homologous among these genes. In genomic cosmid clone banks, about 9% of all colonies hybridize with probes from the 5'- and 3'-edges of the transposed segment, showing that these sequences are linked in the genome. Moreover, the 117 and 118 BC cosmids contain several additional putative VSG genes in tandem, as deduced from hybridization and sequence analyses. We conclude that the VSG genes are highly clustered and share common sequences at the borders of the transposed segment.Images"

253,1983,1H NMR study of an ethidium dimer poly(dA-dT) complex: evidence of a transition between bis and monointercalation.,"Comparative 1H NMR and optical studies of the interaction between poly(dA-dT), ethidium bromide (Et) and ethidium dimer (Et2) in 0.7 M NaCl are reported as a function of the temperature. Denaturation of the complexes followed at both polynucleotide and drug levels leads to a biphasic melting process for poly(dA-dT) complexed with ethidium dimer (t1/2 = 75 degrees C; 93 degrees C) but a monophasic one in poly(dA-dT): ethidium bromide complex (t1/2 = 74 degrees C). In both cases drug signals exhibit monophasic thermal dependence (Et = 81 degrees C; Et2 = 95 degrees C). Evidence is presented showing that the ethidium dimer bisintercalates into poly(dA-dT) in high salt, based on the observation that i) dimer and monomer ring protons exhibit similar upfield shifts upon DNA binding, ii) upfield shifts of DNA sugar protons are twice as large with the dimer than with ethidium bromide. Comparison between native DNA fraction and bound drug fraction indicates that ethidium covers, n = 2.5-3 base pairs. The dimer bisintercalates and covers, n = 5.7 base pairs when the helix fraction is high but as the number of available sites decreases the binding mode changes and the drug monointercalates (n = 2.9)."
254,1983,5S rRNA sequences from eight basidiomycetes and fungi imperfecti.,"The 5S rRNA sequences from the basidiomycetes or fungi imperfecti Rhizoctonia crocorum, Rhizoctonia hiemalis, Exobasidium vaccinii, Trichosporon oryzae, Tilletia controversa, Tilletiaria anomala, Dacrymyces deliquescens and Coprinus radiatus were determined. With the exception of Exobasidium, these sequences conform to the association previously found between septal pore type and sequence. The sequence from the supposed ascomycete anamorph Rhizotonia hiemalis clearly is allied with basidiomycete sequences."
255,1983,5S rRNA sequences from four marine invertebrates and implications for base pairing models of metazoan sequences.,"The nucleotide sequences of 5S rRNAs from the starfish Asterias vulgaris, the squid Illex illecebrosus, the sipunculid Phascolopsis gouldii and the jellyfish Aurelia aurita were determined. The sequence from Asterias lends support for one of two previous base pairing models for helix E in metazoan sequences. The Aurelia sequence differs by five nucleotides from that previously reported and does not violate the consensus secondary structure model for eukaryotic 5S rRNA.Images"
256,1983,A 1H nOe and CD study of the salt-concentration dependence of the structure of d(G-C).,"Intra- and internucleotide 1H nuclear Overhauser effects (nOes) have been observed in the synthetic decancleoside nonaphosphate d(G-C)5 at low and high salt concentrations, and in conditions under which duplex formation is complete. Comparison of the nOes with interproton distances derived from model and X-ray structures suggest that the duplex is right-handed up to a sodium chloride concentration of 4M, in contrast to the behaviour of poly [d(G-C)]. C.D. spectra are consistent with this suggestion."
257,1983,AAF linked to the guanine amino group: a B-Z junction.,"Minimized conformational potential energy calculations have been performed for AAF linked to dCpdG at the guanine amino group. This is a model for the minor AAF adduct observed in DNA, whose conformational influence has been difficult to ascertain. A global minimum energy conformation was computed with torsion angles like those of the dCpdG residue of Z-DNA. This conformation was incorporated into a larger polymer model at a B-Z junction, with the carcinogen residing in the groove in the Z direction. Local minimum energy conformations of the B type were also computed. In addition, two minima were found with fluorenecytidine stacking. These results suggest that existing B-Z junctions may be vulnerable to modification by AAF at the guanine amino group, or that such junctions may be induced by the carcinogen if the base sequence is appropriate. Otherwise the carcinogen can be located in the minor groove of the B helix (5, 10, 11) or covalently intercalated (13-15).Images"

259,1983,A beta-thalassemia lesion abolishes the same Mst II site as the sickle mutation.,"Digestion of DNA from a patient with homozygous beta zero thalassemia from Calabria, Italy with the restriction endonuclease Mst II produced a pattern similar to the one obtained with sickle cell trait DNA in that the Mst II site at the beta 6 position on one chromosome was abolished. We cloned the DNA from this beta-thalassemia chromosome and performed sequence analysis. The deletion of a single nucleotide (A) at the GAG codon of the beta 6 position results in a frame shift and early beta-globin chain termination. This mutation occurs on a chromosome with a haplotype similar to two other Mediterranean beta-thalassemia lesions. The Mst II enzyme is useful for prenatal diagnosis of beta thalassemia in this population.Images"

266,1983,Acceptability of human risk.,"This paper has three objectives: to explore the nature of the problem implicit in the term ""risk acceptability,"" to examine the possible contributions of scientific information to risk standard-setting, and to argue that societal response is best guided by considerations of process rather than formal methods of analysis. Most technological risks are not accepted but are imposed. There is also little reason to expect consensus among individuals on their tolerance of risk. Moreover, debates about risk levels are often at base debates over the adequacy of the institutions which manage the risks. Scientific information can contribute three broad types of analyses to risk-setting deliberations: contextual analysis, equity assessment, and public preference analysis. More effective risk-setting decisions will involve attention to the process used, particularly in regard to the requirements of procedural justice and democratic responsibility."
267,1983,Accumulation of ingested asbestos fibers in rat tissues over time.,"With the use of the transmission electron microscope, asbestos fibers have been assessed in kidney cortex of four groups of rats previously exposed to intermediate-range feeding grade chrysotile asbestos. Newborn rats, from mothers gavaged with asbestos during pregnancy, were gavaged twice a week at the dose level of 50 mg/kg beginning at age day 7 until their natural death or sacrifice. The rats were divided into four groups by age: 0-200, 200-400, 400-600 and 600-800 days. Of the 20 rats comprising the four test groups, 17 were positive, average fiber recovery being 5.34 X 10(3)/mg dry weight. Average fiber level in control tissues was 0.23 X 10(3)/mg dry weight. Fiber recovery in tissues from control animals was shown to be significantly lower (p less than 0.005) than that from test tissues. Test groups showed highly significant differences (p less than 0.005) from each other in the fiber levels. Dose-response relationship was not significant (0.05 less than p less than 0.1). The length distribution and the alterations in morphology of the recovered fibers are described. This study is consistent with the passage of chrysotile asbestos across the gastrointestinal wall."
268,1983,Accurate and efficient in vitro splicing of purified precursor RNAs specified by early region 2 of the adenovirus 2 genome.,"Polyadenylated and deproteinized nuclear RNA precursors encoded by early region 2 of the adenovirus 2 genome are spliced in vitro by nuclear extracts prepared from MOPC-315 mouse myeloma cells. The in vitro reaction excises sequences from two introns and attaches 5' sequences to the mRNA body. The nucleotide sequence across the splice junctions in the E2 RNAs processed in vitro was investigated by performing primer extensions in the presence of dideoxynucleotides and direct sequencing on polyacrylamide gels. We conclude that the in vitro splicing reaction is accurate and has the same precision as that of in vivo E2 cytoplasmic mRNA prepared from Ad2 infected cells. The efficiency of in vitro splicing by the nuclear extracts is very high. Approximately 80% of E2 RNA precursor, on a molar basis, are spliced in vitro to a mature RNA. These findings provide evidence that a nuclear extract prepared from MOPC-315 mouse myeloma cells is capable of accurate and efficient splicing of E2 RNA precursors.Images"
269,1983,Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei.,We have developed a procedure for preparing extracts from nuclei of human tissue culture cells that directs accurate transcription initiation in vitro from class II promoters. Conditions of extraction and assay have been optimized for maximum activity using the major late promoter of adenovirus 2. The extract also directs accurate transcription initiation from other adenovirus promoters and cellular promoters. The extract also directs accurate transcription initiation from class III promoters (tRNA and Ad 2 VA).Images
270,1983,A cDNA clone containing the entire coding sequence of a mouse H-2Kd histocompatibility antigen,We have isolated a cDNA clone carrying a 1560 bp long insert which contains the entire coding and 3‰Û_ untranslated regions of an H-2Kd mouse histocompatibility antigen. Its sequence and overal features are described. They point to the existence of unique properties of DNA sequences associated with the H-2Kd antigen.
271,1983,Acetylation and methylation patterns of core histones are modified after heat or arsenite treatment of Drosophila tissue culture cells,Exposure of Drosophilamelanogaster tissue culture cells to 37å¡C (heat shock) or to arsenite induces a severe deacetylation of core histones and blocks the methylation of histone H3 and H4. Heat shock induces the methylation of histone H2b. These results are discussed in view of chromatin structure and function.Images
272,1983,"Acetylation, deacetylation and acyltransfer","N-Substituted aromatic compounds can be metabolized in most species to N-acetylated derivatives that are themselves subject to further enzymatic transformations, including hydrolysis and N,O-acyltransfer. These proceses can either potentiate or ameliorate the biological responses to these N-substituted derivatives. Decreasing the levels of metabolites, such as arylhydroxylamines may, in some systems, reduce the probability of eliciting adverse biological effects. In others, arylhydroxamic acids produced by the acetylation of arylhydroxylamines may increase their potential for metabolic activation by N,O-acyltransfer. In the rabbit, rat and perhaps other species, the acetyl CoA-dependent N-acetyltransferase is also capable of activating arylhydroxamic acids by N-O-acyltransfer. These cytosolic organotriphosphate ester-resistant enzymes can utilize arylhydroxamic acid as a donor of the acetyl moiety in the acetyl transferase reaction and apparently are capable of activating arylhydroxamic acids because of their ability to O-acetylate the arylhydroxlamine. In mice, N-acetyltransferase and N,O-acetyltransferase seem not to exhibit this relationship. Enzymes from the microsomes of a number of species are also capable of activating arylhydroxamic acids. The particulate-bound enzymes are organotriphosphate ester-sensitive deacylases that are unable to form nucleic acid adducts on incubation with N-methoxy-N-acetylaminoarenes, substrates that are not capable of activation by N,O-acyltransfer. Thus, depending on the specificity of the enzymes involved, N-substituted aromatic compounds may be activated by N,O-acyltransfer during both the acetylation and deacylation process. The influence of this activation in the carcinogenic process is the object of continuing investigation."
273,1983,A chicken repetitive DNA sequence that is highly sensitive to single-strand specific endonucleases.,"A DNA sequence consisting of the 5-mer AGAGG repeated tandemly 32 times has been detected in a chicken genomic clone and found to be present in about 2000 copies per chicken genome. This sequence was highly susceptible to single-strand specific endonucleases isolated from Aspergillus oryzae (S1) and mung bean, but cleavage by a single-strand specific endonuclease isolated from Neurospora crassa occurred only at a pH below 5.5. Endonucleolytic cutting of the AGAGG sequence by the single-strand specific enzymes required a supercoiled substrate and was independent of ionic strength.Images"
274,1983,A circular dichroism study of the structure of Penicillium chrysogenum mycovirus.,"We have examined the absorption and circular dichroism spectra of intact Penicillium chrysogenum virus, empty capsid particles, and isolated double-stranded RNA. The absorbance at 260 nm of intact virus was less than 4% hypochromic relative to the absorbances of the free double-stranded RNA and free viral protein, indicating very little change in the base stacking interactions of the RNA. Circular dichroism studies of intact virus indicate that the capsid protein consists of 45% alpha-helix. Empty capsids, containing a protein of the same molecular weight as intact virus protein, were found to have 30% alpha-helix, suggesting a conformational change in the capsid upon assembly with RNA. The conformation of double-stranded RNA in the virus was slightly altered from the solution structure of the RNA in 0.01 M Na+ and resembled the conformation of double-stranded RNA partially bound with spermidine. However, the virus does not appear to contain polyamines. Electrophoretic experiments indicate a pH- and salt-titratable RNA binding site on the capsid protein in virus disrupted by urea or non-ionic detergents. The results are consistent with significant ionic interactions between the RNA and the capsid protein in the virus.Images"
275,1983,A comparison of the promoter strengths of two eukaryotic genes in vitro reveals a region of DNA that can influence the rate of transcription in cis over long distances.,"We have compared the strength of a trout protamine gene promoter with that of the mouse beta major-globin gene by analysing the relative levels of run-off transcripts produced in a single mammalian in vitro transcription reaction. When the promoters are introduced on separate recombinant plasmids, the protamine transcripts are synthesised with much greater efficiency than those originating from the globin cap site. This enhanced transcription of the protamine gene is again observed when the promoters are applied as separate DNA fragments derived from the same recombinant plasmid. However, when the promoters are linked on a DNA fragment that includes 7 kb of DNA separating the initiation sites, then there is a marked reduction in the protamine signal relative to the globin. Deletion of a region of this fragment that contains the sequences flanking the globin gene at positions -335 to -1400 restores the enhanced protamine gene expression to the levels observed when the promoters are carried on separate DNA fragments.Images"
276,1983,"A conserved nucleotide sequence, coding for a segment of the C-propeptide, is found at the same location in different collagen genes.","The nucleotide sequence of a segment of the chick alpha 1 type III collagen gene which codes for the C-propeptide was determined and compared with the corresponding sequence in the alpha 1 type I and alpha 2 type I collagen genes. As in the alpha 2 type I gene the coding information for the C-propeptide of the type III collagen gene is subdivided in four exons. Similarly, the amino proximal exon contains sequences for both the carboxy terminal end of the alpha-helical segment of collagen and for the beginning of the C-propeptide in both genes. Therefore, this organization of exons must have been established before these two collagen genes arose by duplication of a common ancestor. In several subsegments the deduced amino acid sequence for the C-propeptide of type III collagen shows a strong homology with the corresponding amino acid sequence in alpha 1 and alpha 2 type I. For one of these homologous amino acid sequences, however, the nucleotide sequence is much better conserved than for the others. It is possible that a mechanism of gene conversion has maintained the homogeneity of this nucleotide sequence among the interstitial collagen genes. Alternatively, the conserved nucleotide sequence may represent a regulatory signal which could function either in the DNA or in the RNA."
277,1983,"A convenient synthesis of 6-amino-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one and related 4,6-disubstituted pyrazolopyrimidine nucleosides.","The glycosylation of 4,6-dichloropyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and 4-chloro-6-methylthiopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine via the corresponding trimethylsilyl intermediate and tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-ribofuranose in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate as a catalyst, gave selective glycosylation at N1 as the only nucleoside product. The intermediates 4,6-dichloro-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidine 7 and 4-chloro-6-methylthio-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidine 13 gave new and convenient synthetic routes to the inosine analog 1, the guanosine analog 2, the adenosine analog 3, and the isoguanosine analog 16. Glycosylation of the trimethylsilyl derivative of 6-chloropyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-4-one unexpectedly gave the N2-glycosyl isomer 20 as the major product. A number of new 4,6-disubstituted pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine nucleosides were prepared from these glycosyl intermediates."
278,1983,Activation of aromatic amines to mutagens by bovine bladder and liver cells,"A bovine bladder cell-mediated mutagenesis system using Chinese hamster V79 cells and Salmonella typhimurium as target organisms was developed to investigate the capacity of the bladder urothelium to activate chemical carcinogens. Bovine bladder epithelial cells can activate the aromatic amines AF and 4-ABP to intermediates which mutate V79 cells and S. typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. DMBA was mutagenic to V79 cells but not detectably mutagenic to either Salmonella strain with bladder cell activation. The chemicals tested were not mutagenic to either target organism in the absence of bladder cells. In contrast to the response with DMBA, S. typhimurium was a more sensitive target for the arylamines than V79 cells. These data suggest the value of using multiple end points for assessing metabolic capability. The activation capability of intact bladder cells was compared to disrupted cells, and S-9 prepared from bladder cells used with and without cofactors. When intact cells or S-9 plus cofactors were used as the activation system a dose-dependent increase in revertants was observed for 4-ABP. A bovine liver cell-mediated bacterial mutagenesis system was also developed and the liver and bladder systems compared. For AF, bladder cells appear to be at least ten times more active per viable cell than hepatocytes in producing mutagenic intermediates, while 4-ABP is essentially not mutagenic in the hepatocyte-mediated system. A quantitative comparison of the relative importance of the liver and bladder to activate the chemicals is difficult to make but the data indicate the ability of the bladder epithelium to activate bladder carcinogens."

A small portion (1.3% - 1.9%) of the non histone proteins (NHP) were banded with DNA in a high density region of the gradient. The DNA tightly bound to proteins representing about 0.6% of the total nuclear DNA was degraded after treating cell nuclei with S1 nuclease or DNAse I but resisted to mild micrococcal nuclease digestion. A large portion of the DNA sequences complementary to homologous RNA was concentrated in this DNA-proteins fraction. These finding suggest that a subset of NHP strongly associated to the active DNA regions play a role in the destabilisation of the double helical DNA during transcriptional processes.Images

288,1983,A double helix B-type geometry based on high-resolution proton NMR of single-helical DNA fragments: d(TA)5 x d(TA)5.,A single-helical B-type geometry is presented based on 1H NMR observations on d(TATA) and several other small single-helical DNA fragments. The structure is extended to one complete turn of double-helical DNA and its characteristics are compared with other known B-type structures.
289,1983,Advantages of and problems with short-term mutagenicity tests for the assessment of mutagenic and carcinogenic risk.,"The Salmonella microsomal assay has become an indispensible tool for the screening of mutagens and carcinogens, particularly when a large number of samples have to be tested, as in the present context for the screening of air pollution. However, for a more definite identification of potential carcinogens, a verification of the results from bacterial tests has to be performed with a battery of other tests, including point mutations and chromosomal aberrations in eukoaryotic systems. While there is a close qualitative correlation between the mutagenic and carcinogenic property of chemicals, a corresponding quantitative correlation between the mutagenic and carcinogenic potency is not always found. One reason for this lack of quantitative correlation presumably depends on the fact that cancer is induced in two steps, of which only the initiating, but not the promoting, step constitutes a mutational event, which is reflected by mutagenicity tests. Present mutagenicity tests have concentrated on discrete major mutations, while mutations of polygenes, acting on quantitative characters, have largely been omitted. Mutational data from Drosophila indicate, however, that polygenes mutate at a considerably higher rate than major genes and that they have a comparatively strong effect in heterozygous condition. It seems of great importance to develop appropriate methods to study induced mutations of polygenic systems and to get a better understanding of the properties of these genetic systems and an evaluation of the risk connected with induced mutations in polygenes."
290,1983,Affinity of HMG17 for a mononucleosome is not influenced by the presence of ubiquitin-H2A semihistone but strongly depends on DNA fragment size.,"We have used a two-dimensional (deoxyribonucleoprotein leads to DNA) electrophoretic binding assay to study the interaction of the purified high mobility group protein HMG17 with isolated HeLa mononucleosomes as a function of their DNA fragment size and the presence of ubiquitin-H2A semihistone. No significant differences between affinities of HMG17 for ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated core mononucleosomes were observed. In striking contrast, the apparent affinity of HMG17 for a mononucleosome increases more than 100-fold upon an increase of the length of the mononucleosomal DNA fragment by as few as 3 to 5 bp over the core DNA length (integral of 146 bp). We suggest that the magnitude of this effect is sufficient to explain the preferential binding of HMG17 in vitro to mononucleosomes derived from actively transcribed genes.Images"
291,1983,"A frameshift addition causes silencing of the delta-globin gene in an old world monkey, an anubis (Papio doguera).","A delta-globin gene of an anubis, Papio doguera, was cloned, and the nucleotide sequence of a region of about 2,000 bp including the gene was determined. In comparison with that of pSP3, a delta-globin clone from the gene library of a normal Japanese, the anubis delta-globin gene showed one base addition in the second exon at the codon for amino acid 55, generating a termination codon at the new 59th codon. The other differences found in the region analyzed were not considered to affect expression of the delta-globin gene. Therefore, it was concluded that this frameshift addition was at least one of the causes of silencing of the delta-globin gene in the anubis. In addition, from the sequence divergence in the delta-globin gene, the period of this silencing was estimated to be at most 4 million years, and the divergence of anubis occurred at most 30 million years ago.Images"
292,1983,A functional component of the sea urchin H2A gene modulator contains an extended sequence homology to a viral enhancer.,"The DNA sequences imparting a maximal rate of sea urchin H2A gene transcription in the frog oocyte nucleus were narrowed down by deletion mapping to a DNA segment -165 to -111, far-upstream of the H2A mRNA cap site. C to T base changes in this area create strong down mutations, hence the primary structure of this DNA sequence is of paramount importance to the H2A gene expression. Sequence comparisons suggest that the -165 to -111 region may contain two essential sequence blocks. Most strikingly, the -135 area contains a 14 out of 17 basepair homology to the Moloney murine sarcoma virus enhancer and to topologically related 5' LTR-sequences of the simian sarcoma virus and the murine Friend spleen focus forming virus.Images"
293,1983,A G43 to U43 mutation in E. coli tRNAtyrsu3+ which affects processing by RNase P.,"A novel mutation in the anticodon stem of E. coli tRNA1Tyrsu3+ (G43 to U43) has been characterized. The gene coding for the mutant tRNA, carried by phage phi 80DHA61.3 a derivative of phi 80psu3+su0, produces only 20% of mature suppressor tRNA as compared with phi 80psu3+. Both the mutant tRNA precursor and mature tRNA have an altered conformation. The precursor tRNA coded for by phi 80DHA61.3 is processed by RNase P more slowly than the su3+ precursor and does not form as stable an enzyme-substrate complex as does su3+ precursor. phi 80 DHA61.3 also contains a large deletion which begins in the spacer region between the su3+ gene and the su0- gene, extends through the su0- gene and includes most of the repeated region following the tRNA genes.Images"
294,1983,A general method to select for M13 clones carrying base pair substitution mutants constructed in vitro.,"In this paper we describe a method to select base pair substitution mutants constructed in vitro. The mutagenesis is performed by forcing mistakes during in vitro synthesis from a primer annealed to a single stranded DNA template. The selection is based on the fact that, following transformation, the progeny of the strand elongated in vitro and the template strand have different phenotypes. The method is general and applicable to any DNA segment; the type of base pair substitution and its position can be chosen at will. The combined efficiency of mutagenesis and selection allows for 85% frequency of mutants in all analyzed clones."
295,1983,"A graphical analysis of the interrelationships among waterborne asbestos, digestive system cancer and population density.","Five statistical procedures were used to partial the correlation between waterborne asbestos and digestive site cancer for the putative effects of population density. These include: analysis based on a data subset with roughly homogeneous population density; standard residual analysis (partial correlation); conditional probability integral transformation; analysis based upon ranked data, and use of logarithmic transformation. Nonparametric regression graphical techniques are applied to examine the nature or shape of the asbestos-cancer dose-response curve. Evidence is presented that suggests that there is considerable difference between analyses involving nonhigh-density tracts and non-San Francisco tracts. Evidence is also presented that the modal-type nonparametric regression curve forks or bifurcates when adjustment is made for population density."
296,1983,A human tRNAGlu gene of high transcriptional activity.,"A mixture of low molecular weight RNAs, in which only tRNAs were radiolabelled, was used as a hybridisation probe to select for tRNA-like sequences within a bank of human genomic DNA in lambda Charon 4A. A restriction enzyme digest of one of the selected lambda Charon 4A recombinants contained two fragments (2.4 Kb &amp; 1.8 Kb) which hybridised tRNA and which, when subcloned into pAT153, were transcribed in Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Analysis of the subcloned 2.4 Kb fragment, which was of remarkably high transcriptional activity, revealed the presence of a single gene for tRNAGlu in the middle of the fragment. The sequence immediately preceding the gene has the potential for forming a tRNA-like structure.Images"
297,1983,Air pollutants and the facilitation of cancer metastasis.,"Studies have been carried out to determine whether the inhalation of ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a common air pollutant, could influence the frequency of blood-borne cancer cell metastasis to the lungs. B16 mouse melanoma cells were used as an in vivo test model. the results have indicated that animals inhaling ambient levels of NO2 developed a significantly higher number of melanoma nodules in their lungs than the animals inhaling filtered air. Thus, a new concept for the action of air pollutants is proposed. The question is raised whether similar events are taking place in urban human populations."
298,1983,A large inverted repeat sequence overlaps two acceptor splice sites in adenovirus.,"The distribution of nucleotide sequences resembling functional sites for mRNA splicing was examined by computer-directed searches in order to determine what factors may influence splice site selection in nuclear precursors. In particular, the distribution of large potentially stable hairpin structures or regions of extensive dyad symmetry was studied in adenovirus sequences. One region, spanning 106 nucleotides, was found at 66.4 map units, overlapping back-to-back acceptor sites for two mRNA molecules, those coding for the 100K protein and the 72K DNA binding protein, which are transcribed from opposite strands. This region displays exceptional dyad symmetry and is potentially capable of forming a single, highly stable hairpin when transcribed. It seems likely that the secondary structure as well as the primary structure of RNA plays a role in determining the correct splicing of these mRNA molecules."
299,1983,Alternative hypotheses for the role of promotion in chemical carcinogenesis.,"A new protocol for carcinogenesis in rat liver is described in order that confirmatory experiments might be undertaken concurrently. The basic protocol, designated IPI (initiator + promoter + initiator), is presented in several alternative forms, including the possible use of X-irradiation as the initiator. The rationale is discussed in terms of the two-hit somatic mutation theory of Armitage and Doll, with an initial hit produced by the first dose of initiator and expansion of single cells to sizable clones by promotion thereby increasing the probability of a second hit by the second dose of initiator. The question of relevant mutations was taken up and it was proposed that genes for chalones (C) and for chalone receptors (R) are logical targets for consideration in a two-mutation sequence. Alternative hypotheses pertaining to promoter action were described in terms of possible mechanisms by which nonelectrophilic promoters might simulate a second mutation by increasing or decreasing the levels of a nonchromosomal replicating particle in target cells."
300,1983,A major lysine tRNA with a CUU anticodon in insect mitochondria.,"We have sequenced a lysine tRNA from mosquito mitochondria that has the anticodon CUU. The preponderance of AAA lysine codons in insect mitochondrial genes, the parsimonious organization of the genomes, and the fact that this tRNA is a major component of the mosquito mitochondrial tRNA complement, lead us to suggest that the CUU anticodon recognizes AAC and AAA codons.Images"
301,1984,"1,1-Dichloroethylene: an apoptotic hepatotoxin?","Within 2 hr after 1,1-dichloroethylene administration, the following phenomena occur in livers of fasted rats: dilation and disruption of bile canaliculi, plasma membrane invagination and loss of microvilli, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and loss of density in mitochondrial matrices. Early, selective loss of enzyme activities was localized by histochemical staining to bile canalicular, and inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Biliary permeability to inulin increased, a change suggestive of the breakdown of junctions between hepatocytes. Endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes appeared spared. In addition, scattered, individual hepatocytes exhibited changes characteristic of apoptosis by 2 hr: chromatin aggregation and margination, nucleolar coarse granulation and enlargement, rounded blebs and proturberances on cell surfaces, and the separation of these cells from surrounding parenchyma. In contrast, evidence of plasma membrane leakiness to K+, Ca2+ and soluble cytoplasmic enzymes was not detected until after 2 hr. Based on these observations, we propose that 1,1-dichloroethylene may initiate apoptosis-like cell degradation in selected parenchymal cells prior to or coincident with centrolobular necrosis.ImagesFIGURE 1.FIGURE 2.FIGURE 3.FIGURE 4.FIGURE 4.FIGURE 4.FIGURE 4."
302,1984,16S rRNA oligonucleotide catalog data base.,"We have developed a package of programs to create, maintain and manipulate a data base of 16S rRNA oligonucleotide catalog data. For the first time all the published catalog data is brought together in one place in a readily usable form. The package allows generation of dendrograms, facilitates searches for related oligonucleotides between catalogs, and allows construction of global and local dictionaries. Interactive capabilities allow for searches of the dictionary as well as an associated file of likely oligonucleotide families."
303,1984,1H NMR study of the interaction of bacteriophage lambda Cro protein with the OR3 operator. Evidence for a change of the conformation of the OR3 operator on binding.,"The specific complex between the lambda phage OR3 operator and the Cro protein has been studied by proton NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz. The DNA imino proton resonances of this complex have been assigned to specific base pairs using the known assignments of these resonances for the free operator. Increase of the protein/DNA ratio to complete saturation of the OR3 operator with the Cro protein made it possible to follow the shift changes of the resonances. Ambiguities were resolved by nuclear Overhauser effect measurements on the complex. The shifts of the imino proton resonance positions provide information on the changes induced in the conformation of the operator upon complex formation with a dimer of the Cro protein. The most striking shift occurs for the central (GC 9) base pair, which is known to have no direct contacts with the Cro protein. This shift may be induced by a bend in the OR3 operator DNA at the GC 9 base pair to accommodate the operator for the binding of the Cro protein dimer. The imino proton resonances of two additional base pairs can be observed in the complex, demonstrating an overall stabilization of the DNA structure by the binding of the Cro protein."
304,1984,1H-NMR study of the interaction of daunomycin with B-DNA helices of methylated oligodeoxynucleotides.,"The interaction of daunomycin with B-DNA double helices of several methylated deoxynucleotides, d(C-G-m5C-G), d(m5C-G-C-G), d(C-G-m5C-G-C-G) and d(m5C-G-C-G-m5C-G) in solution was investigated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz. At low temperature (t less than 20 degrees C for the tetramer and t less than 40 degrees C for the hexamers), several daunomycin-DNA complexes were observed in slow exchange with the drug-free DNA duplexes. The presence of daunomycin in a self-complementary double helix cancels the conformational symmetry of the two strands; the proton signals can split into several others owing to the difference between free and intercalated duplexes and to the many possible intercalation sites in a duplex (three for a tetramer, five for an hexamer). A model relating the chemical shifts of splitted proton signals to the various intercalated duplex conformations was given. The results show that one daunomycin molecule is associated with one duplex and that it can enter any intercalation site with equal probability; no side-effects were observed even for very short helices (of a tetramer). In the case of d(C-G-m5C-G) the association constant and the dissociation and association rates of the intercalated complex were evaluated."
305,1984,1H-NMR study of the lambda operator site OL1: assignment of the imino and adenine H2 resonances.,"One- and two-dimensional proton NMR methods are being used to study the synthetic lambda operator site O-L1, a 17 base-pair DNA duplex recognized by lambda repressor and Cro protein. The complete assignment of the 17 imino protons, which participate in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding, and of the eight adenine H2 protons, which lie in the minor groove of the double helix, is presented."
306,1984,"2',3'-Dideoxy-3' aminonucleoside 5'-triphosphates are the terminators of DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerases.","It is shown that 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-aminonucleoside 5'-triphosphates with adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine bases are effective inhibitors of DNA polymerase I, calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha and rat liver DNA polymerase beta. The effect of the above-mentioned compounds is markedly higher than corresponding action of the well-known DNA synthesis inhibitors arabinonucleoside 5'-triphosphates and 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates. 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-aminonucleoside 5'-monophosphate residues incorporate into the 3'-terminus of the primer and terminate the DNA chain elongation. The possibility of using 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-aminonucleoside 5'-triphosphates as terminators for DNA sequencing by the polymerization method is demonstrated.Images"
307,1984,31P-NMR analysis of the B to Z transition in double-stranded (dC-dG)3 and (dC-dG)4 in high salt solution.,"In 4M NaCl solutions (dC-dG)n (n = 3,4; approximately 9 mM) exist as a mixture o +/- B and Z forms. The low and high field components of two 31P NMR resonances originating from internal phosphodiester groups are assigned to the GpC and CpG linkages, respectively. Low temperatures stabilize the Z-forms, which completely disappear above 50 degrees C (n = 3) and 65 degrees C (n = 4). delta H = -44 and -17 kJ/mol for B to Z transition in the hexamer and octamer duplexes, respectively. Temperature dependent changes (0-50 degrees C range) in the spin-lattice relaxation times at 145.7 MHz are distinctly different for the 31P nuclei o +/- GpC and CpG groups. The relaxation data can be explained by assuming that the GpC phosphodiester groups undergo more local internal motion than do the CpG groups."
308,1984,5-Methyldeoxycytidine in the Physarum minichromosome containing the ribosomal RNA genes.,"5-Methyldeoxycytidine (5MC) was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and by restriction enzyme digestion in rDNA isolated from Physarum polycephalum. rDNA from Physarum M3C strain microplasmodia has a significant 5MC content (about half that of the whole genomic DNA). This rDNA contains many C5MCGG sites because it is clearly digested further by Msp I than by Hpa II. However, most 5MC is in other sites. In particular, alternating CG sequences appear to be highly methylated. HPLC of deoxyribonucleosides shows tha most of the transcribed regions contain little or no 5MC. Restriction digestion indicates that there is little or no 5MC in any of the transcribed regions including the transcription origin and adjacent sequences. Over 90% of the total 5MC is in or near the central nontranscribed spacer and most methylated restriction sites are in inverted repeats of this spacer. rDNA is very heterogeneous with respect to 5MC. The 5MC pattern doesn't appear to change with inactivation of the rRNA genes during reversible differentiation from microplasmodia (growing) to microsclerotia (dormant), showing that inactivation is due to changes in other chromatin variables. The 5MC pattern is different between Physarum strains. The possible involvement of this 5MC in rDNA chromatin structure and in cruciform and Z-DNA formation is discussed.Images"
309,1984,A 3' co-terminal family of mRNAs from the herpes simplex virus type 1 short region: two overlapping reading frames encode unrelated polypeptide one of which has highly reiterated amino acid sequence.,"We have used DNA sequencing, mRNA mapping and in vitro translation to characterise three partially overlapping genes in the genome of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1. These genes specify three mRNAs with distinct 5' termini but a common 3' terminus, the longest of which is immediate-early (IE) mRNA-5. The 12,000 MW (12K) IE polypeptide encoded by IEmRNA-5 is translated from an 88 codon open reading frame, leaving a 1200 base 3' non-translated region. The second mRNA (mRNA-B) is initiated within the coding sequence of IEmRNA-5, and encodes a 21K polypeptide. The 12K and 21K polypeptide coding regions do not overlap. The third mRNA (mRNA-C) is initiated within the coding region of mRNA-B, and encodes a 33K polypeptide. The reading frame for 33K has a 110 codon out-of-frame overlap with the 21K reading frame. This is the first instance of overlapping genes described for HSV. The 21K polypeptide is thought to be a DNA binding protein and is remarkable for an array of 24 tandem repeats of the sequence X/Pro/Arg (where X represents predominantly Glu, Asp, Thr, Ser or Val) in its C-terminal portion. This array, which occupies most of the region of overlap with 33K, can vary in repeat number between virus strains.Images"

The extracts also appear to quantitatively end-process and splice the primary tRNA transcripts. Although the extracts could not transcribe a heterologous (yeast) 5S rRNA gene, they did transcribe a yeast tRNALeu gene and slowly process the transcripts. In addition, we have developed a novel strategy for rapidly sequencing uniformly labelled RNAs using base-specific ribonucleases. We have used this procedure to verify the identity of the in vitro transcripts and processing products.Images"
316,1984,A cluster of six tRNA genes in Drosophila mitochondrial DNA that includes a gene for an unusual tRNAserAGY.,"Genes for URF3, tRNAala, tRNAarg, tRNAasn, tRNAserAGY, tRNAglu, tRNAphe, and the carboxyl terminal segment of the URF5 gene have been identified within a sequenced segment of the mtDNA molecule of Drosophila yakuba. The genes occur in the order given. The URF5 and tRNAphe genes are transcribed in the same direction as replication while the URF3 and remaining five tRNA genes are transcribed in the opposite direction. Considerable differences exist in the relative arrangement of these genes in D. yakuba and mammalian mtDNA molecules. In the tRNAserAGY gene an eleven nucleotide loop, within which secondary structure formation seems unlikely, replaces the dihydrouridine arm, and both the variable loop (six nucleotides) and the T phi C loop (nine nucleotides) are larger than in any other D. yakuba tRNA gene. As available evidence is consistent with AGA codons specifying serine rather than arginine in the Drosophila mitochondrial genetic code, the possibility is considered that the 5'GCU anticodon of the D. yakuba tRNAserAGY gene can recognize AGA as well as AGY codons."
317,1984,ACNUC: a nucleic acid sequence data base and analysis system.,"Structured as a data base and associated with data analysis tools, ACNUC allows both on-line access to a central computer and local exploitation of published nucleotide sequences. Its data retrieval capabilities seem to be presently the most powerful available."
318,1984,A colorimetric method for DNA hybridization.,"A general method has been developed which allows crosslinks to be produced between proteins and single-stranded DNA. Such single-stranded DNA protein complexes have been tested for blot hybridization using two colorimetrically detectable enzymes, namely peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase, as the protein moiety of the probe. After hybridization and incubation with a substrate solution sequences complementary to the probe can be visualized directly without the need of tedious cytochemical sandwich methods. This procedure will detect target sequences, a few kilobases long, in the 1- to 5-pg range.Images"
319,1984,A common philosophy and FORTRAN 77 software package for implementing and searching sequence databases.,"I present a common philosophy for implementing the EMBL and GENBANK (BBN-Los Alamos) nucleic acid sequence databases, as well as the National Biological Foundation (Dayhoff) protein sequence database. The associated FORTRAN 77 fully transportable software package includes: 1) modules for implementing each of these databases from the initial magnetic tape file, 2) modules performing a fast mnemonic access, 3) modules performing key-string access and allowing the definition of user-specific database subsets, 4) a common probe searching module allowing the stacking of multiple combined search requests over the databases. This software is particularly suitable for 32-bit mini/microcomputers but would eventually run on 16-bit computers."
320,1984,A comparison of yeast ribosomal protein gene DNA sequences.,"The DNA sequences of eight yeast ribosomal protein genes have been compared for the purpose of identifying homologous regions which may be involved in the coordinate regulation of ribosomal protein synthesis. A 12 bp homology was identified in the 5' DNA sequence preceding the structural gene for 6 out of 8 yeast ribosomal protein genes. In each case the homologous sequence was found at a position approximately 300 bp preceding the transcription start of the ribosomal protein gene. This homology was not identified in any non-ribosomal protein gene examined. Additional homologies between ribosomal protein genes were identified in the transcribed regions, including the untranslated 5' and 3' DNA regions flanking the coding regions."
321,1984,A complete and a truncated U1 snRNA gene of Drosophila melanogaster are found as inverted repeats at region 82E of the polytene chromosomes.,"A phage containing two sequences homologous to U1 snRNA was isolated from a Drosophila melanogaster genomic library, and identified with a previously cloned D. melanogaster U1 snRNA gene. DNA sequence analysis showed that complete and truncated U1 snRNA genes are present, both of which have base substitutions relative to U1 snRNA. These genes show conservation of 5' and 3' flanking regions relative to other U1 and U2 snRNA genes of Drosophila. Intramolecular renaturation experiments and electron microscope mapping demonstrates that the two U1 snRNA sequences are present as inverted repeats about 2.7kb apart, separated by a smaller pair of inverted repeats of an unrelated sequence. These U1 snRNA sequences were located by in situ hybridization at 82E, and related sequences were found at 21D and 95C on the polytene chromosome map. The results are discussed with reference to the origin and function of snRNAs.Images"
322,1984,A comprehensive sequence analysis program for the IBM personal computer.,"We have developed a versatile program for the analysis of nucleic acid and protein sequences on the IBM Personal Computer. The program is interactive and self-instructing. It contains all the features generally found in sequence analysis programs on large computers, including extensive homology routines, as well as new procedures for the entry of sequence data. The program contains facilities to store and utilize the entire Nucleic Acid Sequence Data Bank. We have devised a new algorithm to find restriction enzyme sites, which allows our microcomputer program to find all sites on a small plasmid for 100 different enzymes in 1 to 2 minutes."
323,1984,A comprehensive set of sequence analysis programs for the VAX.,The University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG) has been organized to develop computational tools for the analysis and publication of biological sequence data. A group of programs that will interact with each other has been developed for the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX computer using the VMS operating system. The programs available and the conditions for transfer are described.
324,1984,A computer algorithm for testing potential prokaryotic terminators.,"The nucleotide sequences of 30 factor-independent terminators of transcription with RNA polymerase from E. coli have been compiled and analyzed. The standard features - a stretch of thymine residues and a preceding dyad symmetry - are shared by most sequences, but there are striking exceptions which indicate that these features alone are not sufficient to describe these sites. In two thirds of the sequences the 3'-half of the dyad symmetry contains the pentanucleotide CGGG (G/C) or a close derivative; about one third have TCTG or a close derivative just downstream of the termination point. The TCTG -box might be implied in termination of stringently controlled operons of E. coli. An algorithm to locate terminators in templates of known nucleotide sequence has been constructed on the basis of correlation to the distribution of dinucleotides along the aligned signal sequences. The algorithm has been tested on natural sequences of a total length of about 11,500 N. It finds all known independent terminators and only a few other sites, including some of the rho-dependent and putative terminators."

329,1984,A computer program package for storing and retrieving DNA/RNA and protein sequence data.,"A computer program package has been made available which contains five compound programs written in FORTRAN 10 (for DECsystem-10). Program DATBAS is for storing and improving DNA sequence data, especially those obtained by the sequencing method using M13 phages. Programs NUCDAT and PROTEN are for analyzing DNA/RNA and protein sequence data, respectively. They contain various options to help users in analyzing DNA/RNA and protein sequence data. With program NUCDAT, it is also possible to get access to the EMBO Nucleotide Data Library. This can be achieved by running program COPY to create two data files from the library. Program LITRAT enables users to prepare a scientific literature file convenient for writing scientific articles, and program STRAIN for storing information concerning bacterial and/or plasmid strains."

331,1984,A conserved sequence element is present around the transcription initiation site for RNA polymerase A in Saccharomycetoideae.,"To identify DNA elements involved in the initiation of rRNA transcription in yeast we located the start site of the rRNA operon of Kluyveromyces lactis and Hansenula wingei, both members of the Saccharomycetoideae, by S1 nuclease analysis and determined the surrounding nucleotide sequences. Comparison of these sequences with those of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, S. cerevisiae and S. rosei (all belonging to the same yeast subfamily) reveals an identical sequence at the site of transcription initiation from position +1 to +7 which is part of a larger conserved region extending from position -9 to +23; the conserved heptanucleotide sequence is supposed to constitute an important part of the promoter for yeast RNA polymerase A. The non-transcribed spacers (NTS) upstream of position -9 have diverged strongly with the exception of two short elements around positions -75 and -135. The external transcribed spacer (ETS) downstream of position +23 is largely conserved between K. lactis, S. rosei and S. carlsbergensis except for a divergent region around position +75. On the other hand, the ETS of H. wingei has diverged significantly.Images"
332,1984,"A convenient and adaptable package of computer programs for DNA and protein sequence management, analysis and homology determination.","We describe the further development of a widely used package of DNA/protein sequence analysis programs (1). Important revisions have been made based on user experience, and new features, multi-user capability, and a set of large scale homology programs have been added. The programs are very user friendly, economical of time and memory, and extremely transportable. They are written in a version of FORTRAN which will compile, with a few defined changes, as FORTRAN 66, FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN IV, FORTRAN IV+, and others. They are running on a variety of microcomputers, minicomputers, and mainframes, in both single user and multi-user configurations."
333,1984,A convenient method for locating sets of related short sequences in DNA sequences of any length.,"In investigating sequence variants in a family of highly repeated rat DNA, we needed to search the consensus sequence of the repeat unit of this family for short sequences which would become, with one base change, recognition sites for various restriction endonucleases. To do this, we have designed a pair of programs to search DNA sequences of any length for sets of related short sequences, allowing user-specified mismatches in the short sequence. Since putative regulatory regions are generally short sequences, these programs are also useful for locating all possible versions of such sequences in any given DNA. We describe the programs, and present results of searches using the programs."
334,1984,"A crystalline end product produced by the hydrolytic cleavage of an RNA-like fragment by an organometallointercalator: 1,10-phenanthroline-platinum(II)-ethylenediamine-cytidine 3' monophosphate.","1,10-Phenanthroline-platinum(II)-ethylenediamine ( PEPt ) forms a crystalline complex with cytidine-3'-phosphate (3'-CMP) and its structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography. 3'-CMP molecules are hemiprotonated and form hydrogen-bonded pairs that stack above and below the phenanthroline-platinum(II) drug molecule. Sugar residues are in the C2' endo conformation, with glycosidic torsional angles intermediate between the high and low anti forms. The structure is of particular interest since it forms as an end product of the hydrolytic cleavage of the dinucleoside monophosphate, CpG, by the platinum organometallointercalator ( PEPt ). This hydrolytic activity appears to be specific for the RNA dinucleoside monophosphate fragment, since deoxycytidylyl (3'-5')deoxyguanosine (d-CpG) and other deoxyribooligonucleotides are not cleaved under similar conditions."
335,1984,Activation of a human c-K-ras oncogene.,"The human lung carcinomas PR310 and PR371 contain activated c-K-ras oncogenes. The oncogene of PR371 was found to present a mutation at codon 12 of the first coding exon which substitutes cysteine for glycine in the encoded p21 protein. We report here that the transforming gene of PR310 tumor contains a mutation in the second coding exon. An A----T transversion at codon 61 results in the incorporation of histidine instead of glutamine in the c-K-ras gene product. By constructing c-K-ras/c-H-ras chimeric genes we show that this point mutation is sufficient to confer transforming potential to ras genes, and that a hybrid ras gene coding for a protein mutant at both codons 12 and 61 is also capable of transforming NIH3T3 cells. The relative transforming potency of p21 proteins encoded by ras genes mutant at codons 12, 61 or both has been analyzed. Our studies also show that the coding exons of ras genes, including the fourth, can be interchanged and the chimeric p21 ras proteins retain their oncogenic ability in normal rodent established cell lines."
336,1984,Acute and subchronic toxicity of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether.,"The available information on the acute and subchronic toxicity of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether is reviewed. Data from animal studies have been examined from the standpoint of dose-response relationships and the sensitivity of various animal species, including man, to the effects of this chemical. In view of recent findings with other chemically related glycol ethers, particular attention has been given to possible adverse effects on blood and testicular tissue. In evaluating the hazard that this chemical may pose to man, consideration has been given to likely routes of exposure and its irritant properties. It is concluded that the available information continues to support the current ACGIH TWA8-TLV of 25 ppm with a STEL of 75 ppm."
337,1984,A cytological map of the human X chromosome--evidence for non-random recombination.,"The cytological location of six cloned DNA sequences on the human X chromosome has been determined to a high resolution by direct hybridisation 'in situ' to metaphase chromosomes. Each locus has been identified using clones which also detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms by Southern hybridisation. The six loci identified are spaced along the chromosome from Xp22 to Xq28. By combining data obtained using this powerful sequence localisation technique with that from hybrid cell panels and from family studies, it is possible to compare physical and genetic distances, and to demonstrate that the frequency of reciprocal genetic exchange is not uniform along the chromosome length.Images"
338,1984,Adaptive response of Micrococcus luteus to alkylating chemicals.,"Wild type M. luteus cells have been adapted by a step-wise treatment with sub-lethal concentrations of MNNG. The adapted cells exhibit 5.7 fold increased resistance to the killing effects of the mutagen and a simultaneous efficient removal of various base modifications present in cellular DNA. A protein extract prepared from adapted cells contains inducible repair functions which can reduce 80-90% of the alkylated DNA content of 06-MeG is effected by a transmethylase and there is no concomitant release of the modified base. However, N-3 MeG is released as a free modified base through the action of a DNA glycosylase. The release of N-3 MeA is unaffected by the induction treatment whereas that of N-7 methylpurine is slightly improved in the adapted cells."

340,1984,Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in cells derived from humans with severe combined immunodeficiency is due to an aberration of the ADA protein.,"In order to determine the molecular basis of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in cells derived from patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) disease, we used a human ADA cDNA clone (1) to analyse the organization and transcription of the ADA gene in both normal and ADA-SCID cells. In five lymphoblastoid ADA-SCID cell lines we could detect no deletions or rearrangements in the ADA gene and its flanking sequences. Furthermore, synthesis and processing of ADA mRNA appeared to be normal in the ADA-SCID cells, and ADA-specific mRNA from two ADA-SCID cells could be translated in vitro into a protein with the molecular weight of normal ADA; this protein, however, could hardly be precipitated with an ADA antiserum. The results indicate that in these two ADA-SCID cell lines, the lack of ADA activity is not due to transcriptional or translational defects, but to subtle changes in the configuration of the protein affecting both its enzymatic and immunological characteristics.Images"
341,1984,Adenovirus DNA synthesized in the presence of aphidicolin.,"Adenovirus types 2 and 5 DNA synthesized in vivo and in vitro in the presence of aphidicolin were studied. Inhibition of adenoviral DNA synthesis by aphidicolin was only 70% even at a concentration of 30 micrograms/ml of aphidicolin, at which the cellular DNA synthesis was completely inhibited. When initiation of the viral DNA synthesis was synchronized with hydroxyurea and labeled with [3H]thymidine for 60 min, the viral DNA synthesized in the presence of 30 micrograms/ml of aphidicolin was not of full length (35 kb) but small (approximately 12 kb) by analysis of alkaline sucrose density gradient centrifugation. When initiation of the viral DNA synthesis was not synchronized, the viral DNAs ranging from full size to 12 kb were synthesized in the presence of aphidicolin, indicating that the nascent DNAs longer than about 12 kb can continue to elongate in the presence of aphidicolin. This 12 kb DNA was not derived from the degradation products of newly synthesized full size adenoviral DNA. The viral DNA synthesis was restored and the full size of adenoviral DNA was attained within 15 min following removal of aphidicolin. About 20% of the entire viral genome length from the 5'-end was not inhibited by aphidicolin, while the synthesis of interior fragments of the adenoviral DNA was markedly inhibited by aphidicolin, judging from the electrophoretic pattern on neutral agarose gel after digestion of DNA with Hind III. These results indicate that aphidicolin inhibits adenoviral DNA replication at the internal region located approximately 20-30% from both terminals.Images"
342,1984,Adenovirus mutants with DNA sequence perturbations in the intragenic promoter of VAI RNA gene allow the enhanced transcription of VAII RNA gene in HeLa cells.,"Ad2 VAI gene strongly competes for transcription with VAII gene in vitro. It has been suggested that this competition may be a basis for the large excess of VAI gene transcription in virus infected cells at late times. We have studied the effect of the DNA sequence perturbations of the intragenic promoter of the VAI gene on transcription of VAII gene at the level of viral chromosome. Several Ad5 mutants with mutations in the promoter of VAI gene were constructed and transcription of their VAI and VAII genes were analyzed in the infected cells. It was found that transcription of VAII gene increased dramatically when either Box A or Box B promoter sequences of VAI gene were mutated or when the entire VAI gene was replaced by a DNA segment with an unrelated DNA sequence. Thus, at late times, active transcription of VAI gene appears to partially repress transcription of VAII gene. Those mutants which synthesized large quantities of VAII RNA only grew more slowly yielding a titer which was 1/10 of that of their parent but 5 to 6 fold higher than that of an Ad5 mutant lacking both VAI and VAII genes.Images"
343,1984,A detailed analysis of an HSV-1 early promoter: sequences involved in trans-activation by viral immediate-early gene products are not early-gene specific.,"This report describes a detailed analysis of the functional DNA sequences within the HSV-1 glycoprotein D gene promoter. The transcriptional activity of deletion and insertion promoter mutants was studied after both trans activation, mediated by viral products, and cis activation by a linked SV40 enhancer. Two G-rich areas (upstream of a TATA signal) were identified as important regions of the promoter. These ""upstream"" signals were active in both orientations. A functional TATA-box region was detected. A second region, not homologous to the concensus TATA sequence, also appeared to have a role in the positioning of the RNA cap-sites, which included both purine and pyrimidine 5' ends. Deletion of the cap-site region resulted in a moderate reduction in transcription. All the promoter elements were important for both cis and trans activated transcription. No sequence specific for viral (trans) regulation was detected, implying that Early promoters are not distinguished by specific sequences. Since HSV-1 and some other animal viruses can activate transcription from unrelated promoters, this process is probably non-specific and applicable to many, particularly extra-chromosomal, genes. The possible mechanisms of this activation are discussed.Images"
344,1984,A DNA analysis program designed for computer novices working in an industrial-research environment.,"A program designed for DNA sequence analysis by people with no computer background or experience is described. The criteria used in the program design were (i) user friendliness, (ii) ability to handle large DNA files (greater than 10 kilobases), (iii) low storage requirements so that it could be put on a personal computer (IBM), (iv) written in a widely used language (FORTRAN 77) and (v) ability to handle all of the needed tasks for DNA analysis. The program consists of an executive that controls a set of modular subprograms. A file management system using 'SEQ' and 'SITE' files is also in place. SEQ files contain long DNA nucleotide sequences (e.g. restriction enzyme sites). Related SEQ and SITE files are grouped into categories. A SITE category can include related sequences a user wishes to search for in a longer SEQ sequence from a designated category. For example, all of the restriction enzyme recognition sites can group into a single category called 'Enzymes' and can be searched for in a SEQ sequence which has been placed in the SEQ file category 'Plasmids'. Colour graphics is also used as a visual aid."
345,1984,A DNA fragment from the human X chromosome short arm which detects a partially homologous sequence on the Y chromosomes long arm.,"An X linked human DNA fragment (named DXS31 ) which detects partially homologous sequences on the Y chromosome has been isolated. Regional localisation of the two sex linked sequences was determined using a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids. The X specific sequence is located at the tip of the short arm ( Xp22 .3-pter), i.e. within or close to the region which pairs with the Y chromosome short arm at meiosis. However the Y specific sequence is located in the heterochromatic region of the long arm ( Yq11 -qter) and lies outside from the pairing region. DNAs from several XX male subjects were probed with DXS31 and in all cases a double dose of the X linked fragment was found, and the Y specific fragment was absent. DXS31 detects in chimpanzee a male-female differential pattern identical to that found in man. However results obtained in a more distantly related species, the brown lemur, suggest that the sequences detected by DXS31 in this species might be autosomally coded. The features observed with these X-Y related sequences do not fit with that expected from current hypotheses of homology between the pairing regions of the two sex chromosomes, nor with the pattern observed with other X-Y homologous sequences recently characterized. Our results suggest also that the rule of conservation of X linkage in mammals might not apply to sequences present on the tip of the X chromosome short arm, in bearing with the controversial issue of steroid sulfatase localisation in mouse.Images"

347,1984,A DNA-recombinogenic activity in human cells.,"A DNA recombining protein has been partly purified from cell lines derived from patients suffering from the hereditary disease, Bloom's syndrome. The protein induces the formation of displacement loops in phi X174 RFI DNA molecules after the addition of single-stranded DNA fragments. A filter binding method and electron microscopy were used to determine the reaction. The recombinogenic protein is dependent on divalent cations and ATP for activity.Images"
348,1984,A DNA sequence analysis package for the IBM personal computer.,"We present here a collection of DNA sequence analysis programs, called ""PC Sequence"" (PCS), which are designed to run on the IBM Personal Computer (PC). These programs are written in IBM PC compiled BASIC and take full advantage of the IBM PC's speed, error handling, and graphics capabilities. For a modest initial expense in hardware any laboratory can use these programs to quickly perform computer analysis on DNA sequences. They are written with the novice user in mind and require very little training or previous experience with computers. Also provided are a text editing program for creating and modifying DNA sequence files and a communications program which enables the PC to communicate with and collect information from mainframe computers and DNA sequence databases."
349,1984,A fast homology program for aligning biological sequences.,"The algorithm of Gotoh computes in two passes of MN steps the alignment of a pair of sequences of lengths M and N, subject to a constraint on the form of the gap weighting function. This compares with the previous algorithm of Waterman et al. which runs in M2N steps. Gotoh also gave a method using two passes of (L+2)MN steps in the case where gap weights remain constant for gaps of length greater than L. Here we describe a procedure for computing the alignment (evolutionary distance and optimal path) in a single pass of MN steps for both cases."

351,1985,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as a potent and persistent thyroxine agonist: a mechanistic model for toxicity based on molecular reactivity.","TCDD and thyroxine have common molecular reactivity properties which enable them to present a planar face and lateral halogens in interactions with proteins. These molecular properties are consistent with the structure-toxicity relationship for TCDD and related compounds. Biological evidence is discussed including preliminary studies on the effects of TCDD exposure on tadpole growth and development which is consistent with the possible thyroxine-like activity of TCDD. The work suggests the possibility that toxicity is at least in part the expression of potent and persistent thyroid hormone activity (responses induced by TCDD which qualitatively correspond to those mediated by thyroid hormones). A mechanism for toxicity is proposed which involves receptor proteins; the planar aromatic system controls binding to cytosolic proteins and halogen substituents regulate binding to nuclear proteins. This simple model based on molecular reactivity sheds light on the diversified effects of TCDD and related compound toxicity and on certain thyroid hormone action. The model also permits predictions to be made with regard to the toxicity and thyroid hormone activity of untested compounds. In addition, the model suggests a general mechanism for hormone action based on metabolically regulated differential and cooperative protein receptor binding events in cellular compartments which can explain agonism, antagonism and potentiation within the framework of receptor occupancy theory."
352,1985,3' end structure of the human (2'-5') oligo A synthetase gene: prediction of two distinct proteins with cell type-specific expression.,"Analysis of the sizes of the (2'-5') oligo A synthetase polyadenylated transcripts in various human cell lines by hybridization with a cDNA probe revealed that the pattern of the transcripts was cell-type specific. In order to investigate whether the 1.6 Kb, 1.8 Kb and 3.6 Kb mRNA, which are predominantly expressed in different cell-lines, encode different proteins or could differ in the size of their 3' or 5' untranslated sequences, the corresponding gene was isolated. On Southern blots of human genomic RNA, the cDNA probe hybridize to a 3.1 Kb EcoRI fragment. Three overlapping genomic clones were isolated which contain the same 3.1 Kb EcoRI fragment. Transcriptional mapping of the 3' end of the gene by Northern blots, hybridization translation experiments and sequencing showed that the 1.6 and 1.8 Kb mRNA are produced by a differential processing at the 3' end of the primary transcript of the same gene. The polyadenylation site of the 1.6 Kb mRNA is located 1.9 Kb upstream to the one of the 1.8 Kb mRNA. To produce the latter transcript, a portion of the last exon of the 1.6 Kb mRNA (including a segment coding for a very hydrophobic sequence of 18 amino acids and 3' untranslated sequence) is spliced out. The two mRNAs thus encode two different proteins which could have different affinity for cellular elements. The 3.6 Kb transcript has the same polyadenylation site as the 1.8 Kb mRNA, but contains additional unspliced 3' intron sequences.Images"
353,1985,5-Methylcytidylic modification of in vitro transcript from the rat identifier sequence; evidence that the transcript forms a tRNA-like structure.,"Previous studies showed that the rat identifier sequence, the rodent type 2 Alu family, the rabbit C family and the bovine or goat 73 bp repeat show remarkable resemblance with a few specific tRNA molecules (Sakamoto and Okada, J. Mol. Evol. in press). This paper reports 5-methylcytidylic modification of the in vitro transcript from the ID sequence, and provides further evidence that the transcript forms a tRNA-like structure in vitro. Fingerprint analysis and oligonucleotide mapping suggested that the sequence of the oligonucleotide containing 5-methylcytidine is CpCpm5CpUpGp, which corresponds to the extra and T psi stem regions in the secondary structure of phenylalanine tRNA. Since the sequence of the corresponding oligonucleotide in the phenylalanine tRNA is Cpm5CpCpUpGp, these results suggests that a tRNA (cytosine-5) methyl transferase recognizes the secondary structure of the transcript from the ID sequence rather than the primary sequence. The significance of this modification in relation to the functional role of the ID sequence is discussed.Images"
354,1985,Abasic sites from cytosine as termination signals for DNA synthesis.,"DNA with abasic sites has been prepared by deamination of cytosine followed by treatment of the product with uracil N-glycosylase. Termination in vitro on such templates does not occur until treatment with uracil N-glycosylase. DNA terminated one base before abasic sites created from C's has been used as a template in ""second stage"" reactions. With enzymes devoid or deficient in 3' greater than 5' exonuclease activity purines, particularly adenine, are preferentially added opposite the putative abasic site. 2-Aminopurine behaves more like adenine than like guanine in these experiments. Polymerase beta preferentially incorporates A opposite abasic sites produced from T, and G opposite abasic sites produced from C. We have eliminated an obvious artefact (e.g. strand switching) which might account for this observation.Images"
355,1985,Aberrant recombination events in B cell lines derived from a kappa-deficient human.,"We have analyzed the structure of Ig kappa chain genes in B cell lines derived from a human individual who cannot synthesize any kappa chains, and whose Igs all contain lambda chains (1). We have characterized secondary DNA recombination events at two kappa alleles which have undergone misaligned V-J recombinations. One such secondary recombination has joined the flanking sequences of a V kappa and a J kappa 2 gene segment as if it were the reciprocal product of a V-J kappa 2 recombination, and resulted in the displacement of the recombined VJ kappa 1 gene segments from the C kappa locus. The non-rearranged form of the V kappa fragment which had recombined with the J kappa 2 flank was cloned. Nucleotide sequencing of this fragment identified a V kappa gene that differed by at least 38% from all previously sequenced human V kappa genes. The other V-J kappa segment analyzed has undergone a secondary recombination at a different site from that described above, at a site within the intervening sequence between the J kappa and C kappa gene segments, similar to the location of secondary recombinations which have occurred in lambda + B cell lines from mice and humans (2,3). These results prove that multiple recombinations can occur at one J kappa-C kappa locus.Images"
356,1985,A beta zero-thalassemic beta-globin RNA that is labile in bone marrow cells is relatively stable in HeLa cells.,"We have shown previously that a beta-globin RNA-deficient beta zero-thalassemia is caused by a single base-pair deletion in codon 44 of the human beta-globin gene1. The lack of beta-globin RNA in erythroid cells of these affected individuals is due to extreme beta-globin RNA instability (t 1/2 = 30 min)2. We have further investigated the mechanism of this extreme lability by transiently expressing the beta zero-thalassemic allele in HeLa cells and assaying the stability of the beta-globin RNA that is produced. Surprisingly, the beta zero-thalassemic RNA is much more stable in HeLa cells than in bone marrow cells. Apparently, developing erythroid cells have a mechanism for turning over this thalassemic RNA while cervical carcinoma cells do not. We also have assayed the stability of RNA derived from in vitro-mutagenized beta-globin genes. In HeLa cells, beta-globin RNAs harboring deletions in and around the translation initiation codon accumulate to steady-state levels that are similar to the level of normal beta-globin RNA.Images"
357,1985,A bidirectionally active signal for termination of transcription is located between tetA and orfL on transposon Tn10.,A terminator of transcription with bidirectional activity has been located between the translation termination codons of the genes tetA and orfL on Tn10. These genes are transcribed towards each other. Each orientation of the intervening sequence is shown to reduce the expression of the lacZ and galK genes when cloned between the respective structural gene and its promotor. The 3'ends of the respective mRNAs were determined by S1 mapping. The results confirm that the same sequence capable of forming a stem-loop structure with a GC rich stem is the termination signal for both orientations. In the more efficient tetA orientation (99%-96% reduction of expression) this sequence is followed by a run of six thymines. In the less efficient orfL orientation (96%-78% reduction of expression) it is followed by an AT rich sequence with seven thymines out of eleven base pairs.Images

363,1985,A cDNA clone encoding a glycinin A1a subunit precursor of soybean.,"A cDNA clone covering the whole coding region for a glycinin subunit precursor containing the A1a acidic subunit, one of the A2 family, has been identified from a library of soybean cotyledonary cDNA clones using a mixed oligonucleotide probe. Analysis of the cDNA insert revealed that it contained 1746 nucleotides of mRNA sequence with a 5'-terminal nontranslated region of 54 nucleotides, a signal peptide region corresponding to 19 amino acids, an acidic subunit region (A1a) corresponding to 291 amino acids followed by a basic subunit region corresponding to 185 amino acids, and a 3'-terminal nontranslated region of 207 nucleotides. By comparing the predicted protein sequence of this precursor with that of the legumin A precursor of pea, it was found that glycinin A2 subunit family appeared to be more closely related to the legumin than to the A3 subunit family, and that the evolutional rearrangement of glycinin genes has occurred."
364,1985,A cDNA clone for the precursor of rat mitochondrial ornithine transcarbamylase: comparison of rat and human leader sequences and conservation of catalytic sites.,"We have cloned a DNA complementary to the messenger RNA encoding the precursor of ornithine transcarbamylase from rat liver. This complementary DNA contains the entire protein coding region of 1062 nucleotides and 86 nucleotides of 5'- and 298 nucleotides of 3'-untranslated sequences. The predicted amino acid sequence has been confirmed by extensive protein sequence data. The mature rat enzyme contains the same number of amino acid residues (322) as the human enzyme and their amino acid sequences are 93% homologous. The rat and human amino-terminal leader sequences of 32 amino acids, on the other hand, are only 69% homologous. The rat leader contains no acidic and seven basic residues compared to four basic residues found in the human leader. There is complete sequence homology (residues 58-62) among the ornithine and aspartate transcarbamylases from E. coli and the rat and human ornithine transcarbamylases at the carbamyl phosphate binding site. Finally, a cysteine containing hexapeptide (residues 268-273), the putative ornithine binding site in Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium, and bovine transcarbamylases, is completely conserved among the two E. coli and the two mammalian transcarbamylases.Images"
365,1985,A chemical perspective on the anthracycline antitumor antibiotics.,"The anthracycline antitumor antibiotics occupy a central position in the chemotherapeutic control of cancer. They remain, however, antibiotics of the last resort and thus exhibit toxicity both to the neoplasm and to the host organism. As part of the continuing effort to dissociate the molecular processes responsible for these two separate toxicities, attention has been drawn to the intrinsic redox capacity of their tetrahydronapthacenedione aglycone moiety, and to the possible expression of this redox activity against those biomolecules for which anthracyclines have a particular affinity (polynucleotides and membranes). This review is a synopsis of the present trends and thoughts concerning this relationship, written from the point of view of the intrinsic chemical competence of the anthracyclines and their metabolites. While our ignorance is profound--the precise molecular locus of the antitumor expression of the anthracyclines remains unknown--there is now evidence that the relationship of the anthracyclines to the DNA (possibly requiring enzymatic cooperation) and to the membranes, with neither event requiring redox chemistry, may comprise the core of the antitumor effects. The adventitious expression of the redox activity under either aerobic conditions (in which circumstances molecular oxygen is reduced) or anaerobic conditions (in which circumstances potentially reactive aglycone tautomers are obtained) is therefore thought to contribute more strongly to the host toxicity. Yet little remains proven, and the understanding of the intrinsic chemical competence can do little more than lightly define the boundaries within which are found these and numerous other working hypotheses."
366,1985,A Chinese G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia deletion: comparison to other deletions in the human beta-globin gene cluster and sequence analysis of the breakpoints.,A clone was isolated that contains the deletion junction region from an individual with a deletion associated with Chinese G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero thalassemia. A clone containing the normal DNA corresponding to the 3' breakpoint of this deletion was also isolated. Portions of these two clones were sequenced and compared to the region in the A gamma-globin gene where the 5' breakpoint occurs. This comparison reveals that the breakage and reunion event was nonhomologous and that it probably involved the insertion of 36-41 bases of DNA belonging to the L1 (KpnI) family of repetitive DNA. Genomic mapping revealed that the DNA on the 3' side of this deletion is closely linked in normal DNA to the 3' breakpoints of two different large deletions that are associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). We cloned and mapped 35 kbp of normal DNA from this region (greater than 45 kbp downstream of the human beta-globin gene) that contains the 3' breakpoints of the Chinese thalassemia and the two HPFH deletions. An endogenous retrovirus-like element and several other repetitive sequences are located within this region. We show that the Chinese thalassemia deletion is greater than 80 kbp in length and differs in size from the two HPFH deletions by less than 6%. We also show that the Chinese thalassemia deletion is at least 40 kbp larger than several other deletions associated with a very similar phenotype.Images
367,1985,"A comparative study of the interaction of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin and its zinc complex with DNA using fluorescence spectroscopy and topoisomerisation.","Binding of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (H2TMPyP4+) and its zinc complex (ZnTMPyP4+) to DNA is demonstrated by their coelectrophoresis and by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic methods. Topoisomerisation of pBR322 DNA shows that H2TMPyP4+ unwinds DNA as efficiently as ethidium bromide showing that it intercalates at many sites. ZnTMPyP4+ may cause limited unwinding. Marked changes in the fluorescence spectra of the porphyrins are found in the presence of DNA. The fluorescence intensity of either H2TMPyP4+ or ZnTMPyP4+ is enhanced in the presence of poly (d(A-T)), whereas in the presence of poly (d(G-C] the fluorescence intensity of ZnTMPyP4+ is only slightly affected and that of H2TMPyP4+ markedly reduced. Both the porphyrins photosensitize the cleavage of DNA in aerated solution upon visible light irradiation.Images"
368,1985,A comparison between mammalian and avian fast skeletal muscle alkali myosin light chain genes: regulatory implications.,"A single locus in the mouse, rat and chicken encodes both alkali myosin light chains, MLC1F and MLC3F. This gene has two distinct promoters and gives rise to two different primary transcripts, which are processed by alternative and different modes of splicing to form MLC1F and MLC3F mRNAs. The MLC1F/MLC3F gene is very similar between mouse, rat and chicken, in terms of its overall structure, the length and location of the introns, and the splice site consensus sequences. Nucleotide sequences of coding regions are very conserved but 3' and 5' non coding regions of the mRNAs have diverged. In the MLC1F promoter regions, several blocks of nucleotides are highly conserved (more than 70% homology), especially a sequence of about 70 nucleotides, located between positions -80 and -150 relative to the Cap site. Conserved blocks of homology are also found in the MLC3F promoter regions, although the common sequences are shorter. The presence of such highly conserved nucleotide sequences in the 5' flanking regions suggests that these sequences are functionally important in initiation of transcription and regulation of expression of this complex gene. Primer extension experiments indicate multiple cap sites for MLC3F mRNA.Images"
369,1985,A comparison of the structure of echinomycin and triostin A complexed to a DNA fragment.,"Two members of the quinoxaline antibiotic family, echinomycin and triostin A, form crystals complexed to a DNA fragment with the sequence d(CpGpTpApCpG). The crystal structure of both complexes was solved by X-ray diffraction to near-atomic resolution. The two structures are similar to each other with differences in some details due to the shorter cross bridge of echinomycin. Both molecules act as bis intercalators surrounding the d(CpG) sequence at either end of the double helix. Alanine forms sequence-specific hydrogen bonds to guanines in the minor groove. The two central AT base pairs are held together by Hoogsteen base pairing with adenine in the syn conformation in both complexes. An octahedrally hydrated magnesium ion is found in the crystal lattice that plays an important role in organizing the lattice as well as stabilizing the complex by hydrogen bonding both to base pairs of DNA and to the quinoxaline ring nitrogen atoms in the major groove side of the DNA double helix. A functional description of the various amino acids in quinoxaline antibiotics is given, together with possible modifications that might affect biological activity."
370,1985,A complex of single-strand binding protein and M13 DNA as hybridization probe.,"Single-stranded DNA was complexed to the single-strand binding protein (SSB) of Escherichia coli in a mass ratio of 30:1. The protein moiety of this complex can be labelled by a number of methods of which we have chosen radio-iodination and biotinylation as examples. The SSB-M13 DNA complexes, labelled to high specific activities, were used as probes in hybridization experiments in which 1.6 X 10(-18) moles of immobilized target DNA were detected. The stability of the hybrids was not severely decreased by the binding of SSB. Analysis of hybrids by electron microscopy showed that complexing of DNA with SSB could be used to allow its subsequent identification in the hybrids.Images"
371,1985,A comprehensive laboratory automation system,
372,1985,A convenient technique to compare the efficiency of promoters in Escherichia coli.,"We describe a technique which allows one to insert any promoter in front of the chromosomal malPQ operon. This can be done easily by using only one plasmid, one strain, and two simple selections. Properties of the final chromosomal fusion are such that the level of amylomaltase, the product of the malQ gene, measures quantitatively the efficiency of the inserted promoter. This method was utilized to compare the efficiency of four well-known promoters: lacZp, trp, tac, lambdaPR and three malT activated promoters: malPp, malkP and malEp."
373,1985,Action of acid on oligoribonucleotide phosphotriester intermediates. Effect of released vicinal hydroxy functions.,"When 2'-O-methoxytetrahydropyranyl-5'-O-(9-phenylxanthen-9-yl) uridylyl-(3'----5')-(2',3'-di-O-acetyluridine) 2-chlorophenyl ester (9) is treated with zinc bromide in dichloromethane-propan-2-ol (85:15 v/v) at room temperature, under stringently anhydrous conditions, the corresponding 5'-unblocked dinucleoside phosphate (10) is obtained in 86% isolated yield; however, when no special precautions are taken to exclude moisture, (10) is obtained in only 72% yield. The removal of the 5'-O-(9-phenylxanthen-9-yl) protecting group from (10) with a protic acid (phenyl dihydrogen phosphate) appears to be much less selective and efficient. 80% Acetic acid promoted removal of the methoxytetrahydropyranyl protecting group from the isomeric fully-protected uridylyl-(3'----5')- and uridylyl-(2'----5')-uridine derivatives [(11) and (21c), respectively] leads to virtually identical mixtures [Figures 1a and 1b, respectively] of the partially-protected dinucleoside phosphates [(14) and (15)], 2',3'-di-O-acetyluridine (8), 5'-O-acetyluridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate (16), and 5'-O-acetyluridine 2'(3')-phosphates [(18) and (17)]."
374,1985,Activation of neocarzinostatin chromophore and formation of nascent DNA damage do not require molecular oxygen.,"Thiol-activated neocarzinostatin chromophore abstracts tritium from the 5', but not from the 1' or 2' positions of deoxyribose in DNA and incorporates it into a stable, non-exchangeable form. The abstracted tritium remains covalently associated with the chromophore or its degradation product after treatment with acid or alkali, respectively. Drug activation and the consequent hydrogen abstraction reaction, presumably generating a carbon-centered radical at C-5', do not require molecular oxygen but have a dose-dependent relation with thiol. Under aerobic conditions, where base release and DNA strand breaks with nucleoside 5'-aldehyde at the 5'-ends are produced, hydrogen abstraction from C-5' parallels these parameters of DNA damage. It is possible to formulate a reaction scheme in which the carbon- centered radical at C-5' is an intermediate in the formation of the various DNA damage products found under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions."
375,1985,Acute treatment of mice with cadmium salts results in amplification of the metallothionein-1 gene in liver.,"A variety of genes have been shown to change copy number during development, including rRNA genes in amphibians and chorion proteins in insects. Dihydrofolate reductase and metallothionein-1 (MT-1) genes are present in high copy number in cultured mammalian cells subjected to low levels of agents that will select for cells with amplified copies of specific genes. Recent studies have shown that the metallothionein-1 gene in mouse liver is regulated at the transcriptional level by treatment with heavy metals. We report here that, at cadmium concentrations 5 to 10-fold higher than that required to induce maximal transcription of the MT-1 gene, there is a 2 to 3-fold increase in MT-1 gene concentration in liver nuclear DNA by 6 hours after induction, and extra copies persist up to 3 weeks in the absence of further heavy metal treatment. The extra MT-1 gene copies that appear 6 hours after cadmium treatment are in a conformation that renders them relatively nuclease insensitive.Images"
376,1985,Adenovirus DNA replication in vitro: site-directed mutagenesis of the nuclear factor I binding site of the Ad2 origin.,"The template requirements for efficient adenovirus DNA replication were studied in vitro in a reconstituted system with cloned DNA fragments, containing the Ad2 origin region, as templates. Replication is enhanced by nuclear factor I, a cellular protein that binds specifically to the Ad2 origin. This stimulation is shown to be strongly dependent on the concentration of the adenovirus DNA binding protein. Using synthetic oligonucleotides we have constructed plasmids with base substitutions in the nuclear factor I binding region. Footprint analysis and competition filter binding studies show that two of the three small blocks of conserved nucleotides in this region are involved in the binding of nuclear factor I. The binding affinity can be influenced by the base composition of the degenerate region just outside these two blocks. In vitro initiation and DNA chain elongation experiments with the mutants demonstrate that binding of nuclear factor I to the Ad2 origin is necessary for stimulation. However, binding alone is not always sufficient since a mutation which only slightly disturbs binding is strongly impaired in stimulation of DNA replication by nuclear factor I.Images"
377,1985,Adenovirus E3-early promoter: sequences required for activation by E1A.,"To identify sequences within the adenovirus-5 E3 promoter necessary for E1A trans-activation, a series of promoter deletion mutants were constructed and analysed. A region between positions -82 and -105 was shown to be critical both for E1A induced expression as well as uninduced expression. The importance of this region was confirmed by constructing hybrid promoters consisting of E3 and Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase sequences. The E1A insensitive tk promoter could be converted to an E1A sensitive promoter by replacing sequences upstream of position -79 with the corresponding region of the E3 promoter. This critical region of the E3 promoter contains a sequence 5' AGATGACTA3' which is also present in important upstream regions of the E2A and E4 promoters.Images"
378,1985,Adenovirus sequences required for replication in vivo.,We have studied the in vivo replication properties of plasmids carrying deletion mutations within cloned adenovirus terminal sequences. Deletion mapping located the adenovirus DNA replication origin entirely within the first 67 bp of the adenovirus inverted terminal repeat. This region could be further subdivided into two functional domains: a minimal replication origin and an adjacent auxillary region which boosted the efficiency of replication by more than 100-fold. The minimal origin occupies the first 18 to 21 bp and includes sequences conserved between all adenovirus serotypes. The adjacent auxillary region extends past nucleotide 36 but not past nucleotide 67 and contains the binding site for nuclear factor I.Images
379,1985,Affinity electrophoresis for monitoring terminal phosphorylation and the presence of queuosine in RNA. Application of polyacrylamide containing a covalently bound boronic acid.,"An affinity electrophoretic method has been developed to study the state of terminal phosphorylation of RNAs and the presence of the hypermodified base Q in tRNA. It is based on the copolymerization of acryloylaminophenylboronic acid into standard polyacrylamide gels and the interaction of this derivative with free cis-diol groups present in the RNA. In the case of terminal phosphorylation, free ribose groups are present either as such, or may be introduced by enzymatic reactions specific for a particular phosphorylation pattern (e.g. using T4 RNA ligase or guanylyltransferase). Additionally, tRNA species containing the Q base may be resolved from Q-lacking tRNAs by boronate affinity electrophoresis. The introduction of a non-destructive, one-step electrophoretic procedure not only offers an alternative to classical analytical methods, but also provides a means of isolating such populations of RNAs for which other methods are unavailable or are less convenient.Images"
380,1985,Aflatrem: a tremorgenic mycotoxin with acute neurotoxic effects.,"Tremorgenic mycotoxins induce neurologic symptoms ranging from mental confusion to tremors, seizures and death, and are apparently the only class of mycotoxins with significant central nervous system activity. Tremorgens have been implicated in a number of neurologic diseases of cattle collectively known as staggers syndromes, and pose significant agricultural and health problems for both cattle and humans. Although the effects of tremorgens are thought to result from transient perturbations of amino acid neurotransmitter release mechanisms, there is reason to believe that acute exposures to toxins with such synaptic effects may result in degeneration of neuronal fiber processes. To test this hypothesis, rats were given a single tremorgenic (3 mg/kg, IP) dose of aflatrem, and kinetics of amino acid neurotransmitter uptake was assessed in isolated hippocampal nerve terminals at 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks after injection. Results indicate a decrease in the capacity of the GABA and glutamate uptake systems, which was interpreted as a loss of nerve terminals. The affinity constants suggest a decrease in release of these transmitters as well. In addition to its transient influence on transmitter release, a single low dose of aflatrem is able to induce degeneration of neuronal processes in hippocampal neurotransmitter systems and therefore represents a long-term health threat."

Our results show that a gastrin gene is expressed only in the antral mucosal and pituitary tissues. Based on the amount of gastrin specific probe protected from S1 nuclease digestion in the presence of a given weight of total RNA, the amount of gastrin mRNA present in pituitary is approximately 330 times lower than in antral mucosa. These findings help establish the tissue distribution of gastrin gene expression.Images"

384,1985,A gene family in Drosophila melanogaster coding for trypsin-like enzymes.,"We have isolated a clustered gene family in D. melanogaster that codes for trypsin-like enzymes. The gene family has been localized to 47D-F by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. The four genes in the family are transcribed in alternating orientations, and code for 1000 nt mRNAs. Transcripts are present at all stages of the life cycle. In situ hybridization to mRNA in tissue sections of third instar larvae showed that transcripts were restricted to the mid-gut. One gene was sequenced. The translated amino acid sequence of the proposed active enzyme is 42% homologous to bovine trypsin. Regions of functional importance are more strongly conserved. These include the active site residues asp102, his57, ser195, and the residue asp189 which is reputed to bind the basic residue at the substrate cleavage site. The activation peptide is not homologous to that of most vertebrate trypsins, suggesting a modified activation mechanism. The sequence further strengthens the hypothesis that the chymotrypsin cleavage specificity developed separately in the vertebrates and invertebrates.Images"

386,1985,A highly polymorphic region 3' to the human type II collagen gene.,"We have characterised a highly polymorphic region 1.3kb downstream of the human Type II collagen gene. It consists of a highly AT-rich tandem repetitive region (minisatellite) approximately 650bp long. Two alleles had been observed previously, differing in size by approximately 300bp. When this region was cloned from four unrelated individuals carrying the larger allele, DNA sequence data identified three alleles, suggesting far higher polymorphism than was originally supposed. This minisatellite was shown to be present in a single copy in the human genome, and to have arisen after the divergence of Old and New World monkeys.Images"

389,1985,Airborne acidity: estimates of exposure and human health effects.,"Human health effects have resulted from the inhalation of ambient acidic aerosols, and there is suggestive evidence that current North American levels of exposure are producing excesses in respiratory morbidity. Annual mean mortality rates have been correlated with ambient aerosol concentration indices, with SO4(2-), FP, IP, and TSP having a descending order as predictive coefficients. These pollutant indices also contain H+ in descending mass ratios, and may all be surrogates for H+ as an active agent. Controlled exposure studies in humans and animals provide evidence that acidic aerosols produce greater changes in respiratory mechanical function and rates of particle clearance than other constituents of ambient particulate matter. The strong acid content of the ambient aerosol has not been measured in any of the population based pollutant effects studies in which it is a likely causal factor. The absence of direct measurement data on acidic aerosol in these studies, and their reliance on surrogate indices such as SO2 and SO4(2-), precludes firm conclusions about exposure-response relationships. High priority areas for further investigation include systematic investigation of the spatial and temporal distribution of population exposures; extension and refinement of population response studies in relation to acid aerosol exposures; responses of normal healthy and asthmatic human volunteers to mixtures of acidic aerosols and oxidant vapors under controlled conditions of exposure and exercise intensity; and progression of changes in lung epithelia during repetitive daily exposures of experimental animals to acidic aerosols, oxidants, and their mixtures, with concurrent measurements of particle clearance and respiratory function."

A novel oligonucleotide structure as well as mono- to triribonucleotide stretches were isolated at the 5' end of the short DNA chains. A structure for the novel oligonucleotide is proposed to be p5' X3' pp5' rN, where X represents unidentified nucleoside with a peculiar property. Possible metabolic relationship between these molecules and primer RNA has been discussed.Images"
392,1985,Alpha-amanitin insensitive transcription of the human epsilon-globin gene.,"In vitro transcription was used to show that RNA polymerase III is responsible for the initiation of transcription at a position 200 bp upstream from the epsilon-globin major cap site. High levels of -200 transcription interferes with the RNA polymerase II major cap site transcription. Using DNA mediated transient expression, the ratio of -200 to +1 transcription can be modulated by either the direction of replication or the presence of an enhancing element in the vector. We suggest that this heterogeneous usage of cap sites is not related to epsilon-globin gene transcription in vivo, but is instead the result of a combination of factors inherent to transient expression experiments.Images"
393,1985,alpha-Putrescinylthymine and the sensitivity of bacteriophage phi W-14 DNA to restriction endonucleases.,"The modified base alpha-putrescinylthymine (putT) in phi W-14 DNA blocks cleavage of the DNA by 17 of 32 Type II restriction endonucleases. The enzymes cleaving the DNA do so to widely varying extents. The frequencies of cleavage of three altered forms of the DNA show that putT blocks recognition sites either when it occurs within the site or when it is in a sequence flanking the site. The blocking is dependent on both charge and steric factors. The charge effects can be greater than the steric effects for some of the enzymes tested. All the enzymes cleaving phi W-14 DNA release discrete fragments, showing that the distribution of putT is ordered. The cleavage frequencies for different enzymes suggest that the sequence CAputTG occurs frequently in the DNA. Only TaqI of the enzymes tested appeared not to be blocked by putT, but it was slowed down. TaqI generated fragments are joinable by T4 DNA ligase."
394,1985,Alteration of the DNA double helix conformation upon incorporation of mispairs as revealed by energy computations and pathways of point mutations.,To explain biochemical and genetic data on spontaneous nucleotide replacements in nucleic acid biosynthesis all the 8 mispairs in normal tautomeric forms have been considered. Possible B-conformations of DNA fragments containing each of such mispairs incorporated between Watson-Crick pairs have been found using computations of the energy of non-bonded interactions via classical potential functions. These conformations have no reduced interatomic contacts. The values of each dihedral angle of the sugar-phosphate backbone fall within the limits of those of double-helical fragments of B-DNA in crystals. These values differ from those of the corresponding angles for the low-energy polynucleotide conformations consisting of canonical pairs by no more than 30 degrees (except for the fragment with the U:U pair for which the C4'-C3'-O-P angle differs by about 50 degrees). The difference in experimentally observed frequencies of various nucleotide replacements in DNA biosynthesis correlates with the difference in the energy of non-bonded interactions and with the extent of the sugar-phosphate backbone distortion for the fragments containing the mispairs which serve as intermediates for the replacements.
395,1985,Altered DNA conformations detected by mung bean nuclease occur in promoter and terminator regions of supercoiled pBR322 DNA.,"Mung bean nuclease was used to probe for recognizable DNA unwinding and unpairing in the plasmid pBR322. In negatively supercoiled DNA, but not relaxed DNA, cleavages occurred preferentially in non-coding regions of the genome. The types of nucleotide sequences cleaved and which non-coding regions were cleaved depended upon environmental conditions. At 37 degrees C, cleavages occurred in an 84 bp A+T-rich sequence in the terminator region of the ampicillin-resistance gene. Recognition is likely based on a novel DNA conformation which occurs in the longest, most dA+dT-rich region of pBR322. In the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, cleavages occurred in inverted repeated sequences in the promoter regions of the RNA primer for DNA replication and ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistance genes as well as the terminator of RNA-1. Potential loops of hairpin (cruciform) structures were cleaved. At 27 degrees C, cleavages occurred near a promoter activated by cAMP receptor protein in vitro and in the 3' non-coding region of the tetracycline-resistance gene. Thus, in supercoiled pBR322 DNA, recognizable DNA unwinding and unpairing occurs preferentially in regulatory regions for transcription and DNA replication.Images"

One such unusual mutant is able to bind to the araI site with an affinity only two to three-fold weaker than the wild type AraC protein, but the mutant protein was shown, both in crude extracts and when purified, to contact only two of the three major groove regions of the DNA that are contacted by the wild type protein.Images"
397,1985,"Aluminum in acidic surface waters: chemistry, transport, and effects.","Ecologically significant concentrations of Al have been reported in surface waters draining ""acid-sensitive"" watersheds that are receiving elevated inputs of acidic deposition. It has been hypothesized that mineral acids from atmospheric deposition have remobilized Al previously precipitated within the soil during soil development. This Al is then thought to be transported to adjacent surface waters. Dissolved mononuclear Al occurs as aquo Al, as well as OH-, F-, SO4(2-), and organic complexes. Although past investigations have often ignored non-hydroxide complexes of Al, it appears that organic and F complexes are the predominant forms of Al in dilute (low ionic strength) acidic surface waters. The concentration of inorganic forms of Al increases exponentially with decreases in solution pH. This response is similar to the theoretical pH dependent solubility of Al mineral phases. The concentration of organic forms of Al, however, is strongly correlated with variations in organic carbon concentration of surface waters rather than pH. Elevated concentrations of Al in dilute acidic waters are of interest because: Al is an important pH buffer; Al may influence the cycling of important elements like P, organic carbon, and trace metals; and Al is potentially toxic to aquatic organisms. An understanding of the aqueous speciation of Al is essential for an evaluation of these processes."
398,1985,Alu sequences transcription in X. laevis oocytes: nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning and evidence for 3' end processing reactions.,"A large Alu-family cluster in the 5' flanking region of a human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene has been identified and sequenced. Individual members microinjected into X. laevis oocytes are transcribed only when canonical box A and B components of the split pol III promoter are present. Alu transcripts accumulate in the nucleus. An unusually short Alu transcript, able to assume a stable secondary structure, undergoes a 3' end processing reaction similar to the one required for tRNA 3' end maturation.Images"
399,1985,A lysine-rich protein functions as an H1 histone in Dictyostelium discoideum chromatin.,"Mononucleosomes released from Dictyostelium discoideum chromatin by micrococcal nuclease contained two distinctive DNA sizes (166-180 and 146 bp). Two dimensional gel electrophoresis suggested a lysine-rich protein protected the larger mononucleosomes from nuclease digestion. This was confirmed by stripping the protein from chromatin with Dowex resin. Subsequently, only the 146 bp mononucleosome was produced by nuclease digestion. Reconstitution of the stripped chromatin with the purified lysine-rich protein resulted in the reappearance of the larger mononucleosomes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed the protein was associated with mononucleosomes. Hence, the protein functions as an H1 histone in bringing the two DNA strands together at their exit point from the nucleosome. Trypsin digestion of the lysine-rich protein in nuclei resulted in a limiting peptide of approx. 10 kilodaltons. Trypsin concentrations which degraded the protein to peptides of 12-14 kilodaltons and partially degraded the core histones did not change the DNA digestion patterns obtained with micrococcal nuclease. Thus, the trypsin-resistant domain of the lysine-rich protein is able to maintain chromatosome structure.Images"
400,1985,A mathematical model for the transport and fate of organic chemicals in unsaturated/saturated soils.,"A mathematical model, simulating the transport and fate of nonionizable organic compounds in unsaturated/saturated porous media (soils) in a terrestrial microcosm has been developed. Using the principles of water mass, momentum, heat energy and chemical mass balance, the three fields: moisture, temperature, and liquid phase chemical concentration are solved for simultaneously by coupling the soil slab to an environmentally realistic air-soil interface (a dynamic free boundary) conditions and a prescribed height water table. The environmental conditions at the soil surface-air chamber interface are easily changed, via geometric scaling factors, to simulate either an open agricultural field or a landfill type of situation. Illustrative simulation runs examine the effects of different soil-chemical characteristics on hydrological and chemical concentration profiles."
401,1986,"1731, a new retrotransposon with hormone modulated expression.","We report here the characterisation of 1731, a new copia-like element of Drosophila melanogaster. 1731 was first isolated in a screening for ecdysterone modulated genes. This element is about 4.6 Kb long and is flanked by two long terminal repeats (LTRs) 336 base pairs in length. The whole 1731 element is transcribed into polyA+ RNAs, and these transcripts decrease rapidly upon hormonal treatment. 1731 is moderately repeated in the fly genome and slightly amplified in Kc/cells where extrachromosomal circular forms are found. The LTRs were sequenced in one cloned copy of 1731 and show a structural organisation similar to that of several other copia-like elements and retroviral proviruses. Small nucleotide stretches, similar to those found in Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus LTRs and known to be important in its regulation by a steroid hormone, occur in 1731 LTRs.Images"

In vitro, this endonucleolytic event requires a protein factor which has been isolated and purified from extracts of uninfected E. coli. The terminase host factor (THF) is a heat stable basic protein of M.W. approximately 22,000. The integration host factor (IHF) protein of E. coli can efficiently substitute for THF in the terminase reaction; however, THF can be demonstrated to be physically present in, and isolated with full biological activity from extracts of cells defective or deficient in IHF.Images"
406,1986,A binary vector for transferring genomic libraries to plants.,"The transformation of mutant plants with a complete recombinant library derived from wild-type DNA followed by assay of transformed plants for complementation of the mutant phenotype is a promising method for the isolation of plant genes. The small genome of Arabidopsis thaliana is a good candidate for attempting this so-called shotgun transformation. We present the properties of an A. thaliana genomic library cloned in a binary vector, pC22. This vector, designed to introduce genomic libraries into plants, contains the oriV of the Ri plasmid pRiHR1 by which it replicates perfectly stably in Agrobacterium. Upon transfer of the library from E. coli to A. tumefaciens large differences in transfer efficiencies of individual recombinant clones were observed. There is a direct relation between transfer efficiency and stability of the recombinant clones both in E. coli and A. tumefaciens. The stability is independent of the insert size, but seems to be related to the nature of the insert DNA. The feasibility of shotgun transformation and problems of statistical sampling are discussed."
407,1986,A BR 1 gene in Chironomus tentans has a composite structure: a large repetitive core block is separated from a short unrelated 3'-terminal domain by a small intron.,"The large Balbiani ring (BR) genes in the dipteran genus Chironomus have been considered to be homogeneous repetitive structures. Analysis of a genomic DNA segment now reveals that a BR 1 gene in C. tentans is a composite gene, consisting of two different types of sequences. A 15-20 kb core block of tandemly arranged repeat units extends close to the 3' end of the BR 1 gene and ends in repetitive structures partly different from the repeat units in the core block. A 55 bp long intron separates the core block, which probably constitutes a single exon, from a non-related 3'-exon, comprising the final 332 bp of the translated part of the gene. According to hydrophobicity and secondary structure predictions, the 3'-exon encoded peptide is distinctly different from the repetitive core block domain and attains a globular structure. The carboxyl-terminal peptide domain is likely to be a general feature of BR encoded proteins and may have important functions in the excretion and polymerisation of the secretory proteins.Images"
408,1986,"Absorption, metabolism, and excretion of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate by rats and mice.","There is convincing evidence in the literature that most of the adverse biological effects of phthalate diesters are actually effects of metabolites rather than of the parent compounds. If so, the dramatic species differences in endpoint metabolic profiles make it essential that metabolism of phthalates be understood in detail, including the factors that may alter the metabolism. A metabolic pathway for phthalates having saturated alkyl groups has been postulated based on identification of metabolites produced in vivo and excreted in urine. The first few steps in the postulated pathway have been confirmed in vitro using enzymatically active preparations from rats and mice; some details of the nature of these early steps have been learned. Although some information concerning later steps is available, much remains to be learned in this area. Species differences are postulated to involve kinetics of several biochemical and physiological events acting in concert or competition. Among these interacting factors are competition of at least three enzymes for phthalate monoesters as substrate, relative kidney clearance rates for different metabolites, relative Km values of oxidative enzymes for the same precursors in different species, and relative equilibria between glucuronide formation and hydrolysis. Essential information that must be obtained in the future includes which metabolites play a causal role in which biological effects, and what factors (age, diet, state of health, etc.) can modify the metabolism of phthalate esters and in what way."

The splice junction consensus sequences were virtually identical to those of animal introns except that the polypyrimidine stretch at the 3' splice junction was less pronounced in the plant introns.

415,1986,A cDNA clone of the hnRNP C proteins and its homology with the single-stranded DNA binding protein UP2.,"A cDNA clone which expresses a protein that cross-reacts immunologically with the human C1 and C2 hnRNP core proteins has been isolated. The clone was selected by a sensitive immunochemical assay employing an avidin-biotin complex for detection, and identified as a clone for the hnRNP C proteins by a highly sensitive antibody select assay that is described here. The clone contains 677 nucleotides, and, as shown by northern blotting, is derived from a 1.5 Kb poly(A)+ mRNA. There are regions of strong homology between the human and mouse genes, weak homology is seen with chicken DNA, and very little, if any, homology can be detected with Drosophila, Artemia, sea urchin, or yeast DNAs. Two peptides (a total of 24 amino acids) of the calf thymus single-stranded DNA binding protein UP2 show perfect homology with the deduced amino acid sequence of the clone, suggesting that UP2 is related to the hnRNP C proteins. There is also a region that has a sequence very similar to two regions of the single-stranded DNA binding protein UP1 that contain proposed DNA binding sites.Images"
416,1986,A chimeric mouse histone H4 gene containing either an intron or poly(A) addition signal behaves like a basal histone.,"We have modified the basic structure of the mouse H4 histone gene by introducing, in one case, the IVS-II of the human beta globin gene in the middle of the H4 coding region and, in the second case, the poly(A) addition signal from either the chicken vimentin gene or the alpha globin gene, displacing the hairpin loop structure in the 3' direction. Constructs were placed into the vector, PSV2gpt, and stably transformed into L cells. Pools of 100-500 independent transformants were analyzed for H4 expression. Even though the intron is processed correctly, the growth regulated expression of the modified gene is lost and the gene is now expressed at a constant basal level. Furthermore, unprocessed transcripts accumulate in the nucleus of Go cells when compared to exponentially growing cultures. Polyadenylated H4 RNA is correctly processed but expressed at reduced levels (30 fold) in a constitutive manner, independent of the growth state of the cell. The altered expression of these chimeric H4 genes compared to the endogenous copy or the transfected wild type gene suggests a structural model to explain the cell cycle independent expression of the basal histones.Images"
417,1986,Acinetobacter calcoaceticus encoded mutarotase: nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene and characterization of its secretion in Escherichia coli.,"The nucleotide sequence of the mutarotase gene from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus has been determined. It reveals an open reading frame of 381 amino acids. The codon usage of A. calcoaceticus for this gene is similar to E. coli except for the amino acids Leu, Ala, Glu, and Arg where major differences exist. This did not interfere drastically with high level expression in E. coli. The regulatory sequences for the initiation of translation are similar to the ones described for E. coli. The N-terminal 20 amino acids, which are not found in the mature enzyme, show homology to signal sequences of exported proteins. In A. calcoaceticus and E. coli mutarotase is specifically secreted into the periplasmic space. Processing of the signal sequence occurs at identical sites in both organisms. The mature mutarotase consists of 361 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 38457 Da. Expression of mutarotase at a high level in a recombinant E. coli destabilizes the outer membrane. This results in coordinated leakage of mutarotase and beta-lactamase into the culture broth.Images"
418,1986,"A collection of programs for nucleic acid and protein analysis, written in FORTRAN 77 for IBM-PC compatible microcomputers.","We have developed a collection of programs for manipulation and analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences. The package was written in Fortran 77 on a Sirius1/Victor microcomputer which can be easily implemented on a large variety of other computers. Some of the programs have already been adapted for use on a Vax 11. Our aim was to develop programs consisting of small, comprehensible and well documented units that have very fast execution times and are comfortably interactive. The package is therefore suitable for individual modifications, even with little understanding of computer languages."
419,1986,A combined carcinogen bioassay utilizing both the lung adenoma and skin papilloma protocols.,"To test the feasibility of employing a combined lung adenoma/skin papilloma assay for broader detection of chemical carcinogenesis than that realized with either bioassay done separately, four strains of mice, SENCAR, BALB/c, A/J, and ICR-Swiss, were administered carcinogens either by the oral or intraperitoneal (IP) routes. The carcinogens administered were ethyl carbamate (EC), benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P], N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT), and acrylamide (ACR). Starting 2 weeks later, 1 to 5 micrograms (depending on strain) of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 0.2 mL acetone/mouse was applied three times weekly to the shaved back for 20 weeks. All strains displayed increases in the yield of lung adenomas in response to EC at 32 weeks. B(a)P increased lung adenomas in only the SENCAR and A/J strain. Only the SENCAR and ICR-Swiss mice gave positive responses in the skin. In the SENCAR mice, positive response was seen with all four chemicals, however, FANFT gave an inconsistent response. The ICR-Swiss mice responded with an increased skin papilloma yield only to EC. In a separate experiment involving only SENCAR mice, animals were treated with a single oral dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) followed by triweekly application of 1.0 microgram TPA. This treatment resulted in 51/57 animals developing lung adenomas vs. 5/57 in the control animals. No treatment-related skin tumors resulted with DEN. Histopathologically confirmed lesions indicate that the spectrum of chemicals detected in the SENCAR mouse may be broadened using a combined bioassay that examines both lung and skin responses.ImagesFIGURE 1.FIGURE 2.FIGURE 3.FIGURE 4.FIGURE 5."
420,1986,A comparative study of the regulation of cytochrome P-450 and glutathione transferase gene expression in rat liver.,"A cDNA clone for the Ya subunit of glutathione transferase from rat liver was constructed in E. coli. The clone hybridized to Ya and Yc subunit messenger RNAs. On the basis of experiments involving cell-free translation and hybridization to the cloned probe, it was shown that prototype inducers of cytochrome P-450 such as phenobarbitone and 3-methylcholanthrene as well as inhibitors such as CoCl2 and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole enhanced the glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) messenger RNA contents in rat liver. A comparative study with the induction of cytochrome P-450 (b+e) by phenobarbitone revealed that the drug manifested a striking increase in the nuclear pre-messenger RNAs for the cytochrome at 12 hr, but did not significantly affect the same in the case of glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc). 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole and CoCl2 blocked the phenobarbitone mediated increase in cytochrome P-450 (b+e) nuclear pre-messenger RNAs. These compounds did not significantly affect the glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) nuclear pre-messenger RNA levels. The polysomal, poly (A)- containing messenger RNAs for cytochrome P-450 (b+e) increased by 12-15 fold after phenobarbitone administration, reached a maximum around 16 hr and then decreased sharply. In comparison, the increase in the case a glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) messenger RNAs was sluggish and steady and a value of 3-4 fold was reached around 24 hr. Run-off transcription rates for cytochrome P-450 (b+e) increased by nearly 15 fold in 4 hr after phenobarbitone administration, whereas the increase for glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) was only 2.0 fold. At 12 hr after the drug administration, the glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) transcription rates were near normal. Administration of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and CoCl2 blocked the phenobarbitone-mediated increase in the transcription of cytochrome P-450 (b+e) messenger RNAs. These compounds at best had only marginal effects on the transcription of glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) messenger RNAs. The half-life of cytochrome P-450 (b+e) messenger RNA was estimated to be 3-4 hr, whereas that for glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) was found to be 8-9 hr. Administration of phenobarbitone enhanced the half-life of glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) messenger RNA by nearly two fold. It is suggested that while transcription activation may play a primary role in the induction of cytochrome P-450 (b+e), the induction of glutathione transferase (Ya+Yc) may essentially involve stabilization of the messenger RNAs.Images"
421,1986,A comprehensive package for DNA sequence analysis in FORTRAN IV for the PDP-11.,A computer package written in Fortran-IV for the PDP-11 minicomputer is described. The package's novel features are: software for voice-entry of sequence data; a less memory intensive algorithm for optimal sequence alignment; and programs that fit statistical models to nucleic acid and protein sequences.
422,1986,A computer program for comparative analysis of nucleic acid sequences.,"The programs offer the possibility of comparing pairs of homologous sequences in order to find out percentage of homology, number of identical and deviating nucleotides, of transitions and transversions and, derived from these, KNUC-values according to Kimura (1) and the corresponding standard error sigmaK. The sequences can be printed in pairs underneath each other, homologies are indicated by asterisks between the identical nucleotides. Out of a set of homologous sequences stored on a disk any number of sequences can be compared in pairs in this way, and a matrix containing either the percentage of homology values, the number of deviating nucleotides or the KNUC-values together with the corresponding standard errors can be sent to screen, printer or disk. A program will be available soon which creates a dendrogram representing the similarity between the sequences by use of an average linkage clustering method deduced from this matrix. The programs are written for Apple II computers using UCSD-PASCAL and for Sirius I/Victor 9000 computers using TURBO-PASCAL."
423,1986,A computer program for translating DNA sequences into protein.,"This paper describes a comprehensive program for translating one or two DNA sequences into amino acid sequences.

These programs allow direct input of gel patterns from partial or complete digestion experiments using a digitizer tablet, calculation of molecular weights and restriction maps, plotting of maps and actual or predicted fragment patterns and automated identification of overlapping cosmids from partial restriction mapping results. Programs are written in PASCAL and have been implemented on a VAX/VMS system, with a HP-7221T plotter and a digitizing tablet.Images"

The package now provides a screen oriented user interface, and an enhanced working environment with powerful formatting, disk access, and memory management tools. The new GenBank floppy disk database is supported transparently to the user and a similar version of the NBRF protein database is provided. The programs can use sequence file annotation to automatically annotate printouts and translate or extract specified regions from sequences by name. The sequence comparison programs can now perform a 5000 X 5000 bp analysis in 12 minutes on an IBM PC. A program to locate potential protein coding regions in nucleic acids, a digitizer interface, and other additions are also described."

429,1986,Activation of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum nifH and nifDK operons is dependent on promoter-upstream DNA sequences.,"Previous analysis of B. japonicum nifH'- and nifD'-'lacZ translational fusions showed that these promoters could be activated by the K. pneumoniae nifA plus the E. coli ntrA gene products. To study the functions of the DNA 5' to these promoters, plasmids carrying deletions in this region were constructed and analyzed in vivo in a heterologous system consisting of an E. coli (NtrA+) background with a plasmid that constitutively expresses the K. pneumoniae nifA gene. Activation of the B. japonicum promoters was completely dependent on sequences located between positions -165 and -100, relative to the start of transcription. Some of the nifD deletion-fusions were mobilized to the wild-type B. japonicum and the exconjugants tested in an ex planta micro-aerobic system, and also used to infect soybean seedlings. The time course of derepression was followed by assaying beta-galactosidase activity from samples withdrawn from the microaerobic cultures or from root-nodule extracts. The results conclusively show that in the homologous system the sequences upstream of the promoter are required to achieve wild-type activity."

431,1986,A current genotoxicity database for heterocyclic thermic food mutagens. I. Genetically relevant endpoints.,"Cooking, heat processing, or pyrolysis of protein-rich foods induce the formation of a series of structurally related heterocyclic aromatic bases that have been found to be mutagens. The primary genetic assay utilized to detect and isolate these mutagens has been the his reversion assay in Salmonella typhimurium. The classification and nomenclature of these chemicals is revised to reflect recent advances. The findings of short-term tests for genetic injury that have been applied to these agents are presented in a systematic way. Cell-free, bacterial, mammalian cell culture, and in vivo systems are included. Major results, the mutagens tested, and key references are presented in tabular form, with text commentary. Integrated conclusions on the state of current knowledge of the genetic toxicity of thermic food mutagens are presented. Areas in need of further research are defined. Finally, an outline is presented of a suggested path leading to the determination whether normal methods of food preparation and processing constitute a human health hazard."
432,1986,Adenovirus-2 E1a and E1b gene products regulate enhancer mediated transcription.,"We have shown that adenovirus-2 early region 1 gene products in trans and the SV40 enhancer in cis have an additive effect in stimulating transcription from adenovirus IVa2 and major late promoters (Natarajan, V. and Salzman, N. P., Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4067, 1985). In the present study, we show that both the E1a and E1b gene products are necessary for this stimulatory effect on enhancer mediated transcription. In the absence of E1b region, the transcription is strongly suppressed by E1a. Transcription from E1a promoter is also stimulated 4-5 fold in the presence of E1b region. The data suggest that 21K protein coded by the E1b region modulates transcription from the E1a promoter and the action of E1a gene products on transcription from other promoters.Images"
433,1986,"Adipsin, the adipocyte serine protease: gene structure and control of expression by tumor necrosis factor.","We have isolated, mapped and sequenced adipsin, the adipocyte differentiation-dependent serine protease gene. This gene, which is present in a single form in the mouse, spans 1.7 kilobases and contains five exons. While the basic exon structure characteristic of serine protease genes is conserved in adipsin, there is also a fusion of two exons that are separate in other serine proteases. The sequence data also suggests a mechanism of alternative splicing which appears to account for the generation of two adipsin mRNA species differing by only three nucleotides and encoding two different signal peptides. To investigate the control of adipsin expression we have examined the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on adipocytes. The level of adipsin RNA is dramatically decreased by hormone treatment, but the change occurs more slowly than for other fat cell mRNAs, such as glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. These results show that adipsin is a novel serine protease gene whose expression is regulated by a macrophage-derived factor which modulates expression of other adipocyte-specific RNAs.Images"
434,1986,A DNA sequence analysis program for the Apple Macintosh.,"This paper describes a new set of programs for analyzing DNA sequences using the Apple Macintosh computer, a computer ideally suited for this kind of analysis. Because of the Macintosh interface and the availability of high quality software-only speech synthesis, these programs are truly easy to use. Instead of typing in commands, the user directs the program by making selections with the mouse, thereby eliminating most typographical and syntax errors. Output options are selected by ""pressing buttons"" and then clicking ""OK"" with the mouse. DNA sequences are confirmed by having the program speak them. The high resolution graphics on the Macintosh not only allow for explanatory diagrams to be used to aid in deciding on input parameters, but can be used to produce slides for presentations and figures for papers. Because of the clipboard and the ability of the Macintosh to readily share data among different applications, data can be saved for use directly in word processing documents (e.g. manuscripts)."

436,1986,A dynamic programming algorithm for finding alternative RNA secondary structures.,"Dynamic programming algorithms that predict RNA secondary structure by minimizing the free energy have had one important limitation. They were able to predict only one optimal structure. Given the uncertainties of the thermodynamic data and the effects of proteins and other environmental factors on structure, the optimal structure predicted by these methods may not have biological significance. We present a dynamic programming algorithm that can determine optimal and suboptimal secondary structures for an RNA. The power and utility of the method is demonstrated in the folding of the intervening sequence of the rRNA of Tetrahymena. By first identifying the major secondary structures corresponding to the lowest free energy minima, a secondary structure of possible biological significance is derived.Images"
437,1986,A family of DNA sequences is reproducibly rearranged in the somatic nucleus of Tetrahymena.,"A small family of DNA sequences is rearranged during the development of the somatic nucleus in Tetrahymena. The family is defined by 266 bp of highly conserved sequence which restriction mapping, hybridization and sequence analysis have shown is shared by a cloned micronuclear fragment and three sequences which constitute the macronuclear family. Genomic Southern hybridization experiments indicate there are five members of the family in micronuclear DNA. All of the family members are present in whole genome homozygotes and are therefore nonallelic. The three macronuclear sequences are all present in clonal cell lines and are reproducibly generated in every developing macronucleus. The rearrangement event begins 14 hours after conjugation is initiated and is nearly completed by 16 hours.Images"

441,1986,Age-dependent response of the rat testes to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.,"Spermatogenesis starts soon after birth in the Sprague-Dawley rat but is not fully established until about 56 days of age. When high oral doses of the plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were given to rats of different ages, testicular damage was observed in immature but not in mature animals. Plasma concentration and urinary excretion data suggested that the gastrointestinal absorption of the DEHP-derived metabolite mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was higher in young animals. Young rats were not more susceptible than older for repeated intravenous infusions of DEHP. It is suggested that the age-related difference observed in testicular response after oral administration of DEHP may be due to pharmacokinetic rather than tissue sensitivity differences. It is concluded that in assessing risks of testicular injuries in children exposed to DEHP, additional studies are required using species in which testicular development is more similar to that of humans.ImagesFIGURE 1.FIGURE 2.FIGURE 3.FIGURE 4."
442,1986,Age factors potentiating drug toxicity in the reproductive axis.,"Traditionally, drug toxicity in the reproductive system has been a concern only as it affects fertility and fecundity in young individuals. The purpose of this report is to address the potential problem of synergy between drug actions and abnormal secretion of reproductive hormones that together produce disease in older individuals. Thus, reproductive toxicity has different, but no less serious implications in aging individuals. During aging, the coordinated function of elements within the reproductive neuroendocrine axis degrades. This change promotes atypical secretion of hormones producing abnormal responses in target organs and thus creates a condition with pathogenic potential. Certain drugs may contribute to reproductive toxicity in aging individuals either by accelerating the process of dysregulation and/or by synergizing with hormones to stimulate pathologic changes in target tissues. The geriatric population of the world is increasing, and since it consumes a proportionately larger percentage of drugs than younger groups, this novel form of reproductive toxicity may represent a problem in drug safety that warrants serious consideration."

The following analytical procedures can be performed: 1. display of the sequence, in whole or part, or its complement; 2. search for specified sequences e.g. restriction sites, and in the case of the latter give fragment sizes; 3. perform a comprehensive search for all known restriction enzyme sites; 4. map sites graphically; 5. perform editing functions; 6. base frequency analysis; 7. search for repeated sequences; 8. search for open reading frames or translate into the amino acid sequence and analyse for basic and acidic amino acids, hydrophobicity, and codon usage. Two sequences, or parts thereof, can be merged in various orientations to mimic recombination strategies, or can be compared for homologies. The program is written in HP BASIC and is designed principally as a tool for the laboratory investigator manipulating a defined set of vectors and recombinant DNA constructs."

448,1986,A growth-responsive gene (16C8) in normal mouse fibroblasts homologous to a human collagenase inhibitor with erythroid-potentiating activity: evidence for inducible and constitutive transcripts.,"We present the DNA sequence of an essentially full-length cDNA clone of 16C8, a growth factor-inducible gene isolated from a mouse embryo fibroblast cDNA library. The 0.9-kb mRNA encodes an Mr 22,500 protein that has substantial homology to a human protein with the reported abilities to potentiate erythroid differentiation and to inhibit collagenases and other tissue metalloproteinases. The N-terminus of the predicted protein has a hydrophobic nature characteristic of secreted proteins, and two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation are present. The cytoplasmic concentration of 16C8 mRNA is maximal in mid G1 at about 6 h after serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts. Northern blot analysis showed a progressive reduction in the size of the induced 16C8 transcripts with increasing time after serum stimulation. This was shown to be due to the reduction in length of the poly(A) tails. S1 analysis of the 5' portion of the mRNA revealed the presence of three different species of transcript, only one of which was inducible.Images"
449,1986,A 'hot-spot' for Ty transposition on the left arm of yeast chromosome III.,"The small ring derivative of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, which was formed by a cross-over between HML on the left arm and HMR on the right arm, contains three Ty elements. The class II element Ty 1-17 lies immediately centromere-distal to LEU2 on the left arm while two class I elements are tandemly arranged distal to PGK on the right arm. We have sequenced the regions of chromosome III surrounding Ty 1-17 and have defined a region where a number of transposition events have occurred. This region is flanked by the 5' ends of two tRNA genes, tRNA3Glu on the centromere distal side and tRNA3Leu immediately in front of LEU2. Close to the tRNA3Glu gene there is a region containing degenerate delta sequences organised in opposite orientations. Immediately distal to Ty 1-17 there are two complete solo delta elements, one inserted into the other. The sequence indicates that these two delta sequences were inserted into chromosome II by separate transposition events. A model is presented to explain how this structure arose and the role of solo delta elements in transposon propagation and maintenance is discussed."
450,1986,A human DNA-binding protein is methylation-specific and sequence-specific.,"A nuclear protein isolated from human placenta, methylated DNA-binding protein (MDBP), binds selectively to DNA enriched in 5-methylcytosine. We now demonstrate that MDBP is a sequence-specific, as well as methylation-specific, DNA-binding protein. From ten restriction fragments of pBR322 DNA methylated with human DNA methyltransferase, one was bound to MDBP very much more strongly than any of the others. For this preferential binding to MDBP, the DNA had to be methylated. By a DNase I protection experiment (DNase I footprinting), a 22-base sequence within this methylated restriction fragment was shown to be specifically protected by MDBP. The sequence-specificity of MDBP coupled with its dependence on DNA methylation suggests that this is one of the proteins which modulates important functions of human DNA methylation in vivo.Images"
451,1987,15N labeling of oligodeoxynucleotides for NMR studies of DNA-ligand interactions.,"The amino protons of 15N-labeled DNA were studied as a possible structural probe in NMR investigations of the interaction of DNA with various ligands. Since the imino protons are located in the center of the double helix, and variations of their chemical shift values are difficult to interpret in terms of structural changes, these probes are not very useful. Instead, amino protons are located in the major or minor groove of the DNA and are often directly involved in the binding of a ligand. For a selective probing 4-15NH2-2'-deoxycytidine and 6-15NH2-2'-deoxyadenosine were obtained by chemical synthesis. The labeled nucleosides were introduced in distinct positions of oligodeoxynucleotides by large-scale DNA synthesis. Direct 15N NMR and 1H-15N multiple quantum NMR were applied to detect the corresponding 15N labels or protons attached to the 15N labels. Chemical shift values for the cytidine and the adenosine amino nitrogen and proton resonances of a symmetric 18 base pair lac operator sequence are reported."

Except for the terminal base pairs all imino protons were detected and assigned in the NMR spectrum. The spectra show that in the thymine dimer duplex, contrary to common belief, all base pairs occur in a hydrogen bonded form, although the hydrogen bonds of the two central AT base pairs are substantially weakened. The melting temperature decreases about 13 degrees C on thymine dimer formation."
455,1987,20-Hydroxyecdysone increases levels of transient gene expression in transfected Drosophila cells.,"Methods for increasing the transient level of expression of transfected DNA in cultured Drosophila cells have been examined. Here we show that cells exposed to the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone for 48h prior to transfection show an 4 to 5 fold increase in the levels of expression of transfected DNA. By analysis, in situ, this increase appears to be due to an increase in the number of cells expressing the transfected DNA. The stimulation in levels of expression is not correlated to any specific DNA sequence, nor does it occur if cells are exposed to hormone post-transfection.Images"
456,1987,20-Hydroxyecdysone regulates cytoplasmic actin gene expression in Drosophila cultured cells.,"The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-OHE) induces, in Kc cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells, important morphological transformations and specific changes of enzymatic activities and of protein synthesis. These changes are accompanied by an increase of synthesis and an accumulation of actin. Specific probes were used to reveal transcripts of each actin gene in mRNA populations isolated from cells at various times of 20-OHE treatment. Only the two cytoplasmic actin genes 5C and 42A are expressed in Kc cells and the hormone induces the accumulation of transcripts of these two genes. We have also taken advantage of S1 mapping and extension procedures to identify the 5' ends of the actin mRNAs from these two genes and to compare their respective levels of expression. The 5C gene is more expressed than the 42A one in untreated and in hormone treated cells. The 5C gene encodes three RNAs that differ in their 3' end. The two genes are interrupted by an intervening sequence immediately upstream of ATG initiation codon but not at the same position. The transcription rate for the two genes is increased up to five fold upon 20-OHE treatment, demonstrating a direct effect of the steroid hormone at the transcriptional level for these genes.Images"
457,1987,23S ribosomal RNA mutations in halobacteria conferring resistance to the anti-80S ribosome targeted antibiotic anisomycin.,"Halobacterium (H.) halobium and H. cutirubrum mutants resistant to the anti-80S ribosome targeted inhibitor anisomycin were isolated. Three classes of mutants were obtained: Class I displayed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to anisomycin of 10 micrograms/ml, class II of 25 micrograms/ml and class III of at least 400 micrograms/ml. In vitro polyphenylalanine synthesis assays demonstrated that in those cases tested resistance was a property of the large ribosomal subunit. By primer extension analysis, each mutation class could be correlated with a distinct base change within the peptidyltransferase loop of 235 rRNA. In class I A2472 was changed to C, in class II G2466 was changed to C and in the high-level resistant class III C2471 was replaced by U. A. double mutant - obtained by selection of a class I mutant for high-level anisomycin resistance - acquired the C2471 to U replacement of class III in addition to the class I mutation. The results provide information on the action of a eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor on archaebacterial ribosomes and demonstrate the suitability of organisms with a single rRNA transcriptional unit on the chromosome for direct selection of mutations in ribosomal RNA.Images"

The resulting blocked nucleosides, ethyl 2-cyanomethyl-1-(2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-p-toluoyl-beta-D-erythro- pentofuranosyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (6) and ethyl 2-cyanomethyl-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)- 1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate, were ring closed with hydrazine to form 5-amino-6-hydrazino-1-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-1H- pyrrolo[3,2-c]-pyridin-4(5H)-one (7) and 5,6-diamino-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-1H- pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one (11), respectively. Treatment of 7 with Raney nickel provided the 2'-deoxyguanosine analog 8 while reaction of 11 with Raney nickel followed by palladium hydroxide/cyclohexene treatment gave the 2'-deoxyguanosine analog 13. The anomeric configuration of 8 was assigned as beta by proton NMR, while that of 13 was confirmed as beta by single-crystal X-ray analysis of the deblocked precursor ethyl 2-cyanomethyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (10a)."
460,1987,2D-NMR studies of the unnatural duplex alpha-d(TCTAAAC)-beta-d(AGATTTG).,"The unnatural oligonucleotide alpha-d(TCTAAAC) was synthesized and was found more resistant towards endonucleases than its beta-analog. 2D-NMR experiments allowed the assignment of all non-exchangeable aromatic and sugar protons except for the overlapping 5' -5"" resonances, as well as the exchangeable imino protons of the parallel hybrid duplex alpha-d (TCTAAAC)-beta-d(AGATTTG). NMR studies show that the strength of the association between the alpha-strand and the beta parallel strand is equivalent to that between their anti-parallel complementary beta-analogs beta-d(CAAATCT) and beta-d(AGATTTG). NOE data provide evidence that both duplexes form stable right-helical duplexes with an anti-conformation on the glycosyl linkages and a Watson-Crick pairing. NOESY and COSY spectra allowed us to determine that alpha and beta deoxyriboses adopt a 3' -exo conformation.Images"
461,1987,32P-postlabeling assay for carcinogen-DNA adducts: nuclease P1-mediated enhancement of its sensitivity and applications.,"Exceedingly sensitive assays are required for the detection of DNA adducts formed in humans exposed to low levels of environmental genotoxicants and therapeutic drugs. A 32P-postlabeling procedure for detection and quantitation of aromatic carcinogen-DNA lesions with a sensitivity limit of 1 adduct in 10(7) to 10(8) nucleotides has been described previously. In the standard procedure, DNA is enzymatically digested to 3'-phosphorylated normal and adducted mononucleotides, which are 32P-labeled at 5'-hydroxyl groups by T4 polynucleotide kinase-catalyzed [32P]phosphate transfer from [gamma-32P]ATP. 32P-labeled derivatives are resolved by TLC, detected by autoradiography, and quantitated by counting. This assay has been recently utilized for the determination and partial characterization of DNA adducts formed in somatic and reproductive tissues of rats given the clinically used anticancer drug, mitomycin C. The drug exhibits similar levels of covalent binding to DNA in most tissues. Further studies have revealed that adducted nucleotides are primarily guanine derivatives that are resistant to 3'-dephosphorylation by Penicillium citrinum nuclease P1. The latter observation has been utilized to enhance the 32P-assay's sensitivity to 1 adduct in 10(10) nucleotides for a 10-micrograms DNA sample by postincubation of DNA digests with nuclease P1 before 32P-labeling. The enzyme dephosphorylates the normal nucleotides but not most aromatic and bulky nonaromatic adducts, so that only the latter serve as substrates for the kinase-catalyzed labeling reaction. The new assay has also shown utility in the analysis of very low levels of age- and tissue-related DNA modifications, which might arise from dietary or endogenous compounds, in untreated rats and in humans.ImagesFIGURE 2.FIGURE 5."

463,1987,"5' proximal sequences of a soybean ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene direct light and phytochrome controlled transcription.","Two closely related ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit (SSU) genes, SRS1 and SRS4, are transcribed at high levels in soybean plants in response to light. Transgenic petunia plants containing 5' sequences from SRS1 or SRS4 fused to the polypeptide encoding region of a neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) gene exhibit selectable kanamycin resistance. Deletion of three ATG codons from the region preceding the normal NPTII translation start site has little effect on the levels of kanamycin resistance in transformed plants. Run-on transcription assays in isolated nuclei demonstrate that transcription of the SRS1/NPTII chimera and the native petunia SSU11A gene subfamily is light regulated and under phytochrome control in leaves of transgenic plants. In young expanding leaves of fully light grown plants, transcription of these genes is markedly reduced within minutes of far-red treatment, while ribosomal DNA and actin gene transcription remains unchanged. This is analogous to the transcriptional response we observed for SRS1 and SRS4 in soybean seedlings. These data suggest (1) that transcription of SSU genes in both soybean and petunia require the continued presence or synthesis of phytochrome in the Pfr form and (2) that 5' sequences are sufficient to direct the phytochrome controlled transcriptional response of the SRS1 gene. In fully expanded mature leaves we found the transcription rates of the native SSU11A gene subfamily, the chimeric SRS1/NPTII gene, the rDNA genes, and several other control genes to be reduced markedly after far-red treatment or after extended periods of darkness. The contrast between results in young and mature leaves is discussed.Images"

465,1987,A 230kb cosmid walk in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene: detection of a conserved sequence and of a possible deletion prone region.,"A 230 kb genomic region from the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene has been cloned in a cosmid walk, using an improved vector and by screening the same unamplified library for all steps. The region cloned surrounds the translocation breakpoint characterized by Worton et al and Ray et al, and overlaps by 70 kb the Pert region cloned by Monaco et al. We have identified a region of strong sequence conservation in mammals and chicken, and comparison of the homologous sequences in chicken and man has indicated the presence of two putative protein coding exons. Comparison with the sequence recently published by Koenig et al shows that only one is present in the Duchenne cDNA, and this raises the question of the functional significance of the other conserved sequence. Single copy probes and whole cosmids generated during this work have been used to analyse the corresponding region in Duchenne patients. Of five independant patients shown to be deleted for a probe 30 kb in 3' of the translocation breakpoint, three have the 5' endpoint of the deletion within a region of less than 20 kb, 100 kb away from the probe used to ascertain the deletion. This might suggest the presence of a region where deletions occur preferentially.Images"
466,1987,A 5'----3' exoribonuclease of human placental nuclei: purification and substrate specificity.,"An exoribonuclease that hydrolyzes single-stranded RNA by a 5'----3' mode yielding 5'-mononucleotides has been purified from human placental nuclei. Chromatographic studies of crude placental nuclear extracts suggest that the enzyme is a relatively abundant nuclear RNase. Poly(A) is degraded by a processive mechanism while rRNA is degraded in a partially non-processive manner, possibly because of its secondary structure. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 113,000, derived from determinations of the Stokes radius (43 A) and sedimentation coefficient (6.3 S). Substrates with 5'-phosphomonoester end groups are 10-20 times better than 5'-dephosphorylated substrates. The locale of the enzyme in nuclei of normal human cells as well as its mode of action suggest a role in nuclear RNA processing or turnover."

The crystal structure was solved by direct methods on the basis of 1493 counter X-ray diffraction data (CuK alpha) and refined to R = 5.1%. The configuration of the thiophosphate group is Rp; conformational parameters are: glycosyl torsion angle anti, -151.9(5) degrees, sugar pucker C(3')-endo with P = 27.3 degrees, vmax = 45.5 degrees, six-membered cycle in chair form. The bond distances in the non-esterified P-S and P-O suggest that the negative charge is distributed between the groups. As illustrated in this and other studies, P-O has a much higher affinity for hydrogen bonds than P-S, indicated here by interactions with triethyl-ammonium N-H and O(2')-H as donors. One additional hydrogen bond N(3)-H---0(4) ties the bases which form a ribbon-like structure. 0(2) and S are not engaged in hydrogen bonds. The triethylammonium ion is two-fold disordered."

475,1987,A cell type specific factor recognizes the rat thyroglobulin promoter.,"We have fused a 900 base pair long DNA segment containing the transcriptional start site of the rat thyroglobulin (Tg) gene to the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). The fusion gene has been introduced into three different cell lines derived from the rat thyroid gland and into a rat liver cell line. Expression of the fusion gene was detected only in the one thyroid cell line that is able to express the endogenous Tg gene. The minimum DNA sequence required for the cell type specific expression was determined by deletion analysis; it extends 170 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site. The Tg promoter contains a readily detectable binding sites for a factor present in salt extracts of thyroid cell nuclei. This binding site is not recognized by the nuclear extracts of any other cell type that we have tested, suggesting that it may help mediate the cell type specific expression of the Tg gene.Images"
476,1987,A cellular protein binds to a conserved sequence in the adenovirus type 2 enhancer.,"A sensitive gel retention assay has been utilized to detect proteins from uninfected Hela nuclei which interact with the adenovirus type 2 enhancer. This assay has been employed to monitor fractionation of nuclear extracts. Three enhancer binding factors were resolved by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and one of the factors was further purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. DNase protection experiments have shown that the heparin-Sepharose fraction contains a factor which binds predominantly to the conserved sequence GTGGAAATTT present at position 160 in the adenovirus type 2 genome and found in many viral and cellular enhancers. Protection of this sequence from DNase I digestion was abolished by competition with a synthetic duplex oligonucleotide spanning bases 144-181. This region corresponds to the sequence defined by Hen et al. as possessing enhancer function. Competition experiments indicated that the enhancer binding factor also bound, albeit with reduced affinity, to multiple sites in the Ela upstream region located between positions 192 and 353. Within the sequences which compete are regions with homology to the high affinity site at position 160. The enhancer binding factor also binds with high affinity to sequences within the SV40 enhancer demonstrating that this factor interacts with sequences common to both the adenovirus and SV40 enhancers.Images"

However, the S1 protocol that appears best suited to demonstrate splicing of a particular RNA (using an intronless probe that is 5' end-labelled in the downstream exon) is not diagnostic as expected. Rather, both intron-containing RNA and intronless RNA confer protection of probe across the splice juncture. To unambiguously demonstrate correctly spliced RNAs that begin at a specific initiation site, we present a procedure in which unspliced RNA molecules are first cleaved by RNase H following annealing to an intronic DNA fragment and the remaining RNA is then subjected to S1 analysis using an intronless probe present in vast excess. Only spliced, correctly initiated transcripts can protect the probe across the splice junction and up to residue +1. This RNase H/S1 method provides a broadly applicable technique with which to demonstrate splicing and initiation of a variety of transcripts, especially ones from transfected genes that can arise both from the normal and from activated cryptic initiation sites.Images"
479,1987,A common structural feature in promoter sequences of E. coli.,"We have searched promoter regions of E. coli, structural genes of the same organism, and computer-generated random sequence DNA for the occurrence of common structural features. This is done by converting the base sequence to a series of numbers representing the sequence of helix twist angles and examining these numerical sequences statistically. Common structural features are shared by the promoter regions with a much higher frequency than are found in structural genes or in random sequences. These structures appear to be scattered randomly throughout the promoters, both in terms of the number of such structures per promoter and in terms of location within each promoter. One particular structure consisting of five successive helix twist angles is reported, along with a list of 60 different hexanucleotide sequences that share this structure. The locations of these structural elements in 61 E. coli promoters are also tabulated."
480,1987,A comparison of eukaryotic viral 5'-leader sequences as enhancers of mRNA expression in vivo.,"The 5'-untranslated leader sequences of several plant RNA viruses, and a portion of the 5'-leader of an animal retrovirus, were tested for their ability to enhance expression of contiguous open reading frames for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts, Escherichia coli and oocytes of Xenopus laevis. Translation of capped or uncapped transcripts was substantially enhanced in almost all systems by the leader sequence of either the U1 or SPS strain of TMV. All leader sequences, except that of TYMV, stimulated expression of 5'-capped GUS mRNA with the native prokaryotic initiation codon context, in electroporated protoplasts. Only the TMV leaders enhanced translation of uncapped GUS mRNAs in protoplasts and increased expression of uncapped CAT mRNA in microinjected X. laevis oocytes. In oocytes, the TYMV leader sequence was inhibitory. In transformed E. coli, the TMV-U1 leader enhanced expression of both the native and eukaryotic context forms of GUS mRNA about 7.5-fold, despite the absence of a Shine-Dalgarno region in any of the transcripts. The absolute levels of GUS activity were all about 6-fold higher with mRNAs containing the native initiation codon context. In E. coli, the leaders of AlMV RNA4 and TYMV were moderately stimulatory whereas those of BMV RNA3, RSV and the SPS strain of TMV enhanced GUS expression by only 2- to 3-fold.Images"
481,1987,A comparison of the conformations adopted by some 5-bromovinyl-2'-deoxyuridines and a correlation with their antiviral properties: an X-ray study.,"Crystal structures of (Z)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine, 3',5'-di-O-acetyl-(E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine and 3',5'-di-O-p-chlorobenzoyl-5-(2-dibromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine are compared with each other and with that of the most potent antiviral agent (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (E-BVDU) reported earlier. A comparison of the conformation of 3',5'-di-O-acetyl-pyrimidine nucleoside structures in which intermolecular hydrogen bond network formation is minimized, with those of their parent compounds has shown that the greatest change in rotation about the glycosyl bond and in the sugar ring pucker is exhibited by E-BVDU. Upon acylation this molecule changes from C2'-endo/C3'-exo conformation to C3'-endo/C4'-exo conformation. The relevance of these structures upon the biological activity of the nucleosides and in particular to their ability to be a substrate for thymidine kinase is discussed."

484,1987,A composite transposon 3' to the cow fetal globin gene binds a sequence specific factor.,"Two unusual sequence organizations were found within the beta-globin locus of the cow. Each was a composite, consisting of closely linked Alu-type repeats with a short stretch of genomic non-repetitive sequence, called a lagan, sandwiched between. One lagan was found 3' to the fetal globin gene, while the second lay between the adult globin gene and a globin pseudogene. Southern blot analysis indicated that both lagans appeared twice within the cow haploid genome, with the second copies lying outside the cow beta-globin locus. One of these non-globin locus homologues was cloned and subjected to sequence analysis. Comparison of the DNA sequence data showed that the lagan-Alu composite was transposed as a unit. The lagan 3' to the cow fetal globin gene contains the recognition site for a sequence specific DNA binding factor. This factor was present in extracts from fetal, but not from adult cow tissues.Images"

The stoichiometry of the interaction appears to be one:one with the actinomycin chromophore intercalated between the two GC base pairs. This binding event facilitates the conversion of the flanking repetitive AT regions to an alternating conformation characterized by induced sensitivity of the ApT sequences to attack by DNAse I. The neighboring TpA sequences do not exhibit rate changes as a function of binding of the drug. The potential relevance of such ligand induced DNA structural alterations is discussed.Images"
488,1987,Activation of dihaloalkanes by glutathione conjugation and formation of DNA adducts.,"Ethylene dibromide (1,2-dibromoethane, EDB) can be activated to electrophilic species by either oxidative metabolism or conjugation with glutathione. Although conjugation is generally a route of detoxication, in this case it leads to genetic damage. The major DNA adduct has been identified as S-[2-(N7-guanyl)ethyl]glutathione, which is believed to arise via half-mustard and episulfonium ion intermediates. The adduct has a half-life of about 70 to 100 hr and does not appear to migrate to other DNA sites. Glutathione-dependent DNA damage by EDB was also demonstrated in human hepatocyte preparations. The possible relevance of this DNA adduct to genetic damage is discussed.ImagesFIGURE 3."
489,1987,Activation of human c-raf-1 by replacing the N-terminal region with different sequences.,"Two transformants of NIH 3T3 cells, obtained by the transfection of human colon cancer and normal colon DNAs, contained activated c-raf-1. In both the activated c-raf-1, the 5' half of the c-raf-1 sequence was replaced by sequences other than c-raf-1 as a result of recombinations which occurred at the intron between exons 7 and 8. It was suggested, however, that these recombinations, which conferred the transforming activity on the c-raf-1, occurred during the transfection. In one case analyzed, characteristic sequences were found near the breakpoint and these may be involved in the recombination. It was found, upon analysing the structure of the cDNA derived from one of the activated c-raf-1, that fused mRNA had been transcribed from the recombined gene comprising the non-raf gene and c-raf-1. The mRNA possibly encodes a fused protein. One cDNA clone was derived from alternatively spliced mRNA, although its physiological role is unclear. On comparing the structure of the two human activated c-raf-1 and the rat activated c-raf which we have reported previously, it was revealed that, in these three cases, the sequences joined to the truncated c-raf(-1)1 were different. It was suggested from data which we and others have previously reported that various sequences could be capable of activating c-raf(-1) by replacing its 5' half.Images"
490,1987,Activation of the adenovirus 2 protein IX promoter by DNA replication in a transient expression assay.,"We have studied the effect of template replication on transcriptional activation of the promoters for the adenoviral protein IX and E1a genes using a short-term transient expression assay. DNA replication mediated modulation of the transcriptional activity of these promoters was monitored using plasmids with limited replication capability conferred by the SV40 minimal origin of DNA replication in the monkey kidney cell line, COS M6. Our results indicate a substantial increase in protein IX promoter directed transcription in a dosage-independent manner as a consequence of the DNA replication process. In contrast, the transcriptional activity of the adenovirus 2 E1a promoter was not significantly altered. In addition to this DNA replication-mediated effect, transcription from the protein IX promoter was positively regulated by the adenovirus E1a 13S and E4 gene products but was repressed by the E1a 12S gene product to a limited extent. The evidence suggests that the effect of template replication on the transcriptional activity of plasmid-borne protein IX and E1a gene promoters in this transient expression system closely mimics the situation on the viral chromosome.Images"
491,1987,Activities of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ICP4 genes specifying nonsense peptides.,"Synthetic oligonucleotide linkers containing translational termination codons in all possible reading frames were inserted at various positions in the cloned gene encoding the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) immediate-early regulatory protein, ICP4. It was determined that the amino-terminal 60 percent of the ICP4 gene was sufficient for trans-induction of a thymidine kinase promoter-CAT chimera (pTKCAT) and negative regulation of an ICP4 promoter-CAT chimera (pIE3CAT); however, it was relatively inefficient in complementing an ICP4 deletion mutant. The amino-terminal ninety amino acids do not appear to be required for infectivity as reflected by the replication competence of a mutant virus containing a linker insertion at amino acid 12. The size of the ICP4 molecule expressed from the mutant virus was consistent with translational restart at the next methionine codon corresponding to amino acid 90 of the deduced ICP4 amino acid sequence.Images"
492,1987,Activity of a Streptomyces transcriptional terminator in Escherichia coli.,"A 205bp DNA fragment from the Streptomyces multi-copy plasmid pIJ101 has in vivo terminator activity both in Streptomyces lividans and in Escherichia coli. Termination of RNA synthesis, detected by high-resolution S1 nuclease mapping, occurs at precisely the same nucleotides in both organisms. This suggests that the E. coli RNA polymerase recognizes the same sequence elements and chooses the point(s) of termination in the same way as the corresponding S. lividans enzyme.Images"
493,1987,A cyanogen bromide fragment of S4 that specifically rebinds 16S RNA.,"Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S4 was subjected to cyanogen bromide cleavage and was found to generate a complete cleavage product capable of rebinding 16S rRNA. This fragment, consisting of residues 1-103, was found to bind with an apparent association constant of 11 microM-1. This fragment was used in place of S4 in an in vitro reconstitution experiment. Although the particles formed had a protein composition not significantly different from reconstituted 30S ribosomal subunits, their sedimentation behavior was more like that of particles reconstituted without S4. These results indicate to us that, although residues 104-203 of S4 are involved in the assembly of the 30S ribosome, they are not necessary for the binding of S4 to 16S RNA. Taken with previous results, the domain of S4 involved in specific binding of 16S RNA can be confined to residues 47-103.Images"
494,1987,Adenine specific DNA chemical sequencing reaction.,"Reaction of DNA with K2PdCl4 at pH 2.0 followed by a piperidine workup produces specific cleavage at adenine (A) residues. Product analysis revealed the K2PdCl4 reaction involves selective depurination at adenine, affording an excision reaction analogous to the other chemical DNA sequencing reactions. Adenine residues methylated at the exocyclic amine (N6) react with lower efficiency than unmethylated adenine in an identical sequence. This simple protocol specific for A may be a useful addition to current chemical sequencing reactions.Images"
495,1987,Adenosine deaminase mRNA expression is regulated posttranscriptionally during differentiation of HL-60 cells.,"The expression of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) decreases in the course of the differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemic cell line HL-60, dependent on the pathway chosen. Differentiation to monocytes as induced by the phorbol ester TPA leads to a 50% reduction of enzyme activity. Induction to myeloid cells as induced by DMSO has a slower and less extensive (75% remaining activity) effect. The reduction in ADA enzymatic activity is preceded by a 5-10 fold reduction in ADA-specific mRNA which is also more rapid during TPA-induced differentiation. In contrast, c-myc mRNA expression is both in TPA- and DMSO-induced differentiation reduced to less then 5% of its initial level within 4h. Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the reduction of c-myc-mRNA expression during both TPA- and DMSO-induced differentiation could be ascribed to the abolition of transcription of the third exon, whereas no change in the transcription of the first exon could be observed. No change could be detected in the rate of transcription of either the 5' and 3' parts of the ADA gene during TPA- and DMSO-induced differentiation, indicating that the expression of the ADA gene in HL-60 is controlled at a posttranscriptional level.Images"

Furthermore, for the amino acids coded for by more than one codon, the population of isoaccepting tRNAs is adjusted to the frequency of synonymous codons used in chloroplast protein genes. A comparison by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the tRNA populations extracted from chloroplasts and from chloroplast polysomes shows that all chloroplast tRNAs are involved in protein biosynthesis.Images"
498,1987,A DNA binding protein showing sequence specificity for a region containing the replication origin of Xenopus laevis mitochondrial DNA.,"In Xenopus laevis mitochondria up to 14 different polypeptides with affinity for the DNA, have been identified by the protein blotting technique. Under stringent binding conditions only one polypeptide displayed specific affinity for a restriction fragment containing the H strand origin of replication of the Xenopus laevis mt chromosome. The proteins were fractionated by double stranded DNA cellulose chromatography. Under conditions which favor high affinity interactions between proteins and DNA, a protein of the 2M NaCl step shows specific binding to the DNA fragments containing the D-loop region. Some physical properties of the protein have been studied. It has a MW of 21.5 Kd and a globular shape as can be inferred from the relationship between MW and sedimentation coefficient (2.7 S). It binds non cooperatively to DNA and forms relatively stable complexes as demonstrated by DNA competition experiments.Images"
499,1987,A dnaB-like protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"A dnaB-like protein from P. aeruginosa was purified to near homogeneity using as an assay the immunoprecipitation by E. coli dnaB antiserum in a solid-phase. In the chromatographic characteristics including the affinity to immobilized ATP the dnaB-like protein of P. aeruginosa is similar to the dnaB protein of E. coli with the exception that it does not bind to heparin-Sepharose. The dnaB-like protein has a native molecular weight of about 320,000 as determined by glycerol gradient sedimentation. It consists of several identical subunits of molecular weight of 56,000 as measured in a denaturing SDS gel. Associated with the enzyme is a DNA-dependent ATPase- and helicase activity. The dnaB-like protein is similar to the E. coli dnaB protein with regard to the binding of ATP gamma S and the formation of a ternary complex consisting of the enzyme, ATP gamma S, and phi X174 DNA. However, the enzyme of P. aeruginosa is inactive in a phi X174 DNA-dependent in vitro dnaB complementation assay using an E. coli dnaBts extract.Images"

Its 1H NMR spectrum under low salt conditions has been obtained at 400 MHz and assigned using two-dimensional NMR techniques. The sugar puckers and glycosidic torsions have been determined by inspecting the relative intensities of the intranucleotide NOEs and COSY crosspeaks. At low electrolyte concentration (100 mM NaCl) the molecule exists as a right-handed duplex with twelve Watson-Crick base-pairs and deoxyribose moieties assuming the O1'-endo to C1'-exo pucker.
502,1988,3' end of the malEFG operon in E.coli: localization of the transcription termination site.,"The nucleotide sequence of a 981 bp's HincII-PvuII DNA fragment containing the 3' end of the malEFG operon in E. coli was determined. This sequence displayed a putative Rho-independent transcription termination site localized 87 bp's after the stop codon of malG. When cloned into plasmid pKG1800, the HincII-PvuII fragment containing this structure acted as a strong transcription termination signal. By S1 mapping, we demonstrated that the 3' end of the malEFG transcript coincided with the putative transcription termination site. One short open reading frames orf1 (123 bp) and and the beginning of another one orf2 were localized after malG. The transcription termination site is localized within orf1. Consequently malG is the last gene of the malEFG operon. orf2 corresponds exactly to the 5' part of the xylE gene reported independently (Davis &amp; Henderson, 1987) as the gene coding for the XylE protein, the xylose-proton symport of Escherichia coli.Images"
503,1988,3' processing of pre-mRNA plays a major role in proliferation-dependent regulation of histone gene expression.,"A short histone-like fusion RNA, generated when the RNA 3' processing signal from a mouse histone H4 gene is inserted into a heterologous transcription unit, becomes correctly down-regulated in G1-arrested cells of a temperature-sensitive mouse mastocytoma cell cycle mutant (21-Tb; Stauber et al., EMBO J. 5, 3297-3303 [1986]), due to a specific deficiency in histone RNA processing (LÌ_scher and SchÌ_mperli, EMBO J. 6, 1721-1726 [1987]). In contrast, inhibitors of DNA synthesis, known to stimulate histone mRNA degradation, have little or no effect on the fusion RNA. This RNA can therefore be used to discriminate between regulation by RNA 3' processing and RNA stability, respectively. The fusion RNA is also faithfully regulated in 21-Tb cells arrested in G1 phase by the drug indomethacin or in C127 mouse fibroblasts during a serum starvation experiment. Moreover, nuclear extracts from serum-starved C127 cells show a specific deficiency in a heat-labile component of the histone RNA processing apparatus, similar to that previously observed for temperature-arrested 21-Tb cells. These results suggest that RNA 3' processing is a major determinant for the response of histone mRNA levels to changes in cell proliferation.Images"
504,1988,5'-3' exonucleases in phosphorothioate-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis.,"The application of T7 and lambda exonuclease to phosphorothioate-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was investigated. Oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce single or double base mismatches, an insertion or a deletion (each of 16 bases) were annealed to M13 phage derivatives. Double stranded closed circular DNA (RF IV) containing phosphorothioate internucleotidic linkages in the (-)strand was prepared enzymatically from these templates. A nick was introduced into the (+)strand of the hetroduplex DNA. This nicked DNA (RF II) was subjected to treatment with T7 or lambda exonuclease. Both of these enzymes were able to degrade almost all of the viral (+)strand when presented with DNA containing one or two base mismatches. Repolymerisation of the DNA after the gapping reaction, followed by transfection into E. coli cells gave mutational efficiencies of up to 95%. In the case of RF II DNA prepared with insertion or deletion primers these exonucleases could only partially degrade the viral (+)strand but were nevertheless highly efficient in such mutagenesis experiments.Images"
505,1988,"5' flanking sequence and genomic structure of Egr-1, a murine mitogen inducible zinc finger encoding gene.","Egr-1 is a murine zinc finger encoding cDNA whose expression is modulated by a variety of ligand-receptor interactions and is often coregulated with c-fos (1). This study reports the isolation of a mouse Egr-1 genomic clone, its intron-exon structure, and 935 bp of 5' flanking sequence. The gene spans about 3.8 kb and consists of 2 exons and one 700 bp intron. S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analysis were used to define the transcription initiation site. ""TATA"" and ""CCAAT"" sequences were located at nucleotides -26 and -337 respectively. In addition, there exist five elements whose sequence is nearly identical to the inner core 10 nucleotide region (CCATATTAGG) of the c-fos serum response element, four Sp1 consensus sequences, two AP1 target sequence analogs, and two potential cAMP response elements. These results will ultimately lead to a detailed definition of the intracellular events regulating Egr-1 expression.Images"

Of the 23 mutations, which were sequenced, 16 represent a C/G to G/C transversion. A C/G to T/A transition was found once and a G/C to T/A transversion twice. The remaining 4 mutations are frameshifts, 2 are identical and formed by the insertion of a G/C basepair; the other 2 mutations are due to a duplication of 10 basepairs situated at different positions but with a remarkable homology in base sequence. Fourteen mutations, including the 2 duplications are found in the neighbourhood of a TGCT/ACGA sequence."
511,1988,"9-[(10-(aden-9-yl)-4,8-diazadecyl)amino]-6-chloro-2-methoxy-acridine incises DNA at apurinic sites.","The incision of DNA at apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP-sites) by chloro-6-methoxy-2 [(adenyl-9)-11)-4,8 diazadecyl]amino-9 acridine (Ade-Z-Acr), a 9-aminoacridine linked to an adenine, at nanomolar concentrations is described. Moreover, this drug, Ade-Z-Acr, is one of the most efficient drugs which cleaves DNA at AP-sites. The high activity is the result of the composition of the drug, since the individual components have no incising activity in the concentration range studied. The termini left by the Ade-Z-Acr molecule are a 3'deoxyribose and a 5'nucleotide. The termini and the inability of the Ade-Z-Acr to incise DNA with reduced AP-sites suggest that the mechanism of cleavage is beta-elimination."

513,1988,A 13 bp palindrome is a functional estrogen responsive element and interacts specifically with estrogen receptor.,"Sequences located upstream of the transcription initiation site of the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 (vit A2) gene contain a hormone dependent enhancer that confers estrogen control to the heterologous thymidine kinase (tk) promoter. As a minimal functional estrogen responsive element (ERE), we have defined the 13 bp palindrome GGTCACAGTGACC. This ERE binds estrogen receptor preferentially in vitro. Although the ERE shares some structural features with the glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) it is distinct from this element since it neither binds glucocorticoid receptor in vitro nor does it confer glucocorticoid inducibility to a fusion gene. Point mutations within the ERE decrease its affinity for the estrogen receptor and result in a complete loss of estrogen inducibility.Images"
514,1988,A 5' exo-ribonuclease and RNA ligase of T. brucei.,"We identified a Mg2+ dependent 5' exo-ribonuclease and an RNA ligase in cell-free extracts of Trypanosome brucei. The exo-ribonuclease in S100 or nuclear extracts, removes about 20 nts from the 5' end of SP6 derived capped as well as uncapped RNA and then stops. In contrast to the activity of the exo-ribonuclease on capped SP6 mini-exon transcripts, the exonuclease cannot degrade trypanosome-derived mini-exon transcripts or the mini-exon located at hsp 70 mRNAs. We therefore assume that the four secondary base modifications adjacent to the mini-exon cap, generated in vivo, confer resistance to the exo-ribonuclease. After exonuclease shortening of SP6 transcripts, an RNA ligase catalizes intramolecular ligation, generating a 3'-5' phosphodiester bond in a Mg2+ and ATP dependent reaction.Images"
515,1988,A backtranslation method based on codon usage strategy.,"This study describes a method for the backtranslation of an aminoacidic sequence, an extremely useful tool for various experimental approaches. It involves two computer programs CLUSTER and BACKTR written in Fortran 77 running on a VAX/VMS computer. CLUSTER generates a reliable codon usage table through a cluster analysis, based on a chi 2-like distance between the sequences. BACKTR produces backtranslated sequences according to different options when use is made of the codon usage table obtained in addition to selecting the least ambiguous potential oligonucleotide probes within an aminoacidic sequence. The method was tested by applying it to 158 yeast genes."

522,1988,Absorption and distribution of xenobiotics.,"Extrapolation of pharmacokinetic data between species has been simplified by the advent of more sensitive methods of analysis of chemicals in body tissues and by the capability of inexpensive computers to perform complex calculations. These new methods enable investigators to observe the rates at which target tissues reach equilibrium in different species and to develop mathematical models of these processes. The evaluation of physiological pharmacokinetics from classical or compartmental kinetics is improving the ability to project the long-term behavior of chemicals in body fluids and organs based on independently derived physical, chemical, and physiological constants obtained from simple chemical reactions, tissue culture experiments, or short-term animal studies. Accurate prediction of chemical behavior by such models gives support to hypothetical mechanisms of distribution and accumulation, while significant deviations from predicted behavior signal the existence of previously unsuspected pathways. These techniques permit the simulation of the impact of linear, nonlinear, and saturation kinetics on chemical behavior; the prediction of integrated tissue exposure; and the mapping of the sequence of alternate metabolic pathways that lead to toxicity or detoxification. The discussion will identify the research needs for improving extrapolations between species."
523,1988,Accuracy of intrachromosomal gene conversion in mouse cells.,"Results of several recent studies suggest that homologous recombination and related processes in mammalian cells are highly mutagenic. We have examined the products of intrachromosomal gene conversion events that encompassed the last intron of the chicken thymidine kinase gene. Following plasmid rescue and DNA sequencing, we find no mutations associated with twenty conversion events representing 5380 total base pairs of which 2414 base pairs are intron sequence. Based on these studies we conclude that intrachromosomal gene conversion in mouse cells is not a highly mutagenic process but rather it operates with fidelity."
524,1988,Accurate in vitro cleavage by RNase III of phosphorothioate-substituted RNA processing signals in bacteriophage T7 early mRNA.,"To test the ability of an RNA processing enzyme to cleave chemically-modified RNA substrates, RNA transcripts containing RNase III cleavage sites were enzymatically synthesized in vitro to contain specific phosphorothioate diester internucleotide linkages. One transcript (R1.1 RNA) was generated using phage T7 RNA polymerase and a cloned segment of phage T7 DNA containing the R1.1 RNase III processing site. The second transcript was the phage T7 polycistronic early mRNA precursor, which was synthesized using E. coli RNA polymerase and T7 genomic DNA. The RNA transcripts contained phosphorothioate diester groups at positions including the scissile bonds. The modified RNAs were stable to incubation in Mg2+-containing buffer, and were specifically cleaved by RNase III. RNA oligonucleotide sequence analysis showed that the modified R1.1 RNA processing site was the same as the canonical site and contained a phosphorothioate bond. Furthermore, RNase III cleaved the phosphorothioate internucleotide bond with 5' polarity. RNase III cleavage of phosphorothioate substituted T7 polycistronic early mRNA precursor produced the same gel electrophoretic pattern as that obtained with the control transcript. Thus, RNase III cleavage specificity is not altered by phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages.Images"

This N4-alkylamino deoxycytidine derivative has been incorporated into oligonucleotide probes during chemical DNA synthesis. Subsequent to deprotection and purification, fluorescent (fluorescein, Texas Red and rhodamine), chemiluminescent (isoluminol), and enzyme (horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase) labels have been specifically incorporated. Detection limits of the labels and labeled probes were assessed. Also, the detection limits and nonspecific binding of the labeled probes in sandwich hybridization assays were determined. The enzyme modified oligonucleotides were found to be significantly better labeling materials than the fluorescent or chemiluminescent derivatives, providing sensitivities comparable to 32P-labeled probes.Images"
534,1988,A comparison of the solution structures and conformational properties of the somatic and oocyte 5S rRNAs of Xenopus laevis.,"The secondary and tertiary structures of Xenopus oocyte and somatic 5S rRNAs were investigated using chemical and enzymatic probes. The accessibility of both RNAs towards single-strand specific nucleases (T1, T2, A and S1) and a helix-specific ribonuclease from cobra venom (RNase V1) was determined. The reactivity of nucleobase N7, N3 and N1 positions towards chemical probes was investigated under native (5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 20 degrees C) and semi-denaturing (1 mM EDTA, 20 degrees C) conditions. Ethylnitrosourea was used to identify phosphates not reactive towards alkylation under native conditions. The results obtained confirm the presence of the five helical stems predicted by the consensus secondary structure model of 5S rRNA. The chemical reactivity data indicate that loops C and D are involved in a number of tertiary interactions, and loop E folds into an unusual secondary structure. A comparison of the data obtained for the two types of Xenopus 5S rRNA indicates that the conformations of the oocyte and somatic 5S rRNAs are very similar. However, the data obtained with nucleases under native conditions, and chemical probes under semi-denaturing conditions, reveal that helices III and IV in the somatic 5S rRNA are less stable than the same structures in oocyte 5S rRNA. Using chimeric 5S rRNAs, it was possible to demonstrate that the relative resistance of oocyte 5S rRNA to partial denaturation in 4 M urea is conferred by the five oocyte-specific nucleotide substitutions in loop B/helix III. In contrast, the superior stability of oocyte 5S rRNA in the presence of EDTA is related to a single C substitution at position 79.Images"
535,1988,A comparison of two phage coat protein-RNA interactions.,"The interaction between the coat protein of the group I bacteriophage fr with its translational operator site is compared with the previously studied R17 interaction. The sequence of the two RNA binding sites differ by 2 of 20 nucleotides and two coat proteins by 17 of 129 amino acids. An analysis of the binding of fr coat protein to 24 operator variants revealed that the two proteins recognize operator sequences in virtually the same way. However, fr coat protein binds to nearly every RNA 6 to 14-fold tighter than R17 coat protein. Since the fr operator is a weaker binding variant and the fr coat protein shows a different temperature dependence of binding, it is unlikely that the two systems have different Kas in vivo. RNA fragments containing the operator sequences can initiate the capsid assembly with both fr and R17 coat protein. Surprisingly, the two coat proteins can form a mixed capsid in vitro.Images"

The titrator consists of widely used, commercially available components; therefore, major attention is given to modes of interconnection and software implementation in data format and system control. Replicate potentiometric titrations of glycines gave a relative standard deviation in titre of 1.035% and a relative standard deviation in pH of 0.745%. Replicate spectrophotometric titrations of bromophenol blue were analysed at three wavelengths to yield pKa= 3.898 å± 0.075 (1.9% rsd). Methods of data presentation and manipulation are presented."
538,1988,A computer graphics program system for protein structure representation.,"We have developed a computer graphics program system for the schematic representation of several protein secondary structure analysis algorithms. The programs calculate the probability of occurrence of alpha-helix, beta-sheet and beta-turns by the method of Chou and Fasman and assign unique predicted structure to each residue using a novel conflict resolution algorithm based on maximum likelihood. A detailed structure map containing secondary structure, hydrophobicity, sequence identity, sequence numbering and the location of putative N-linked glycosylation sites is then produced. In addition, helical wheel diagrams and hydrophobic moment calculations can be performed to further analyze the properties of selected regions of the sequence. As they require only structure specification as input, the graphics programs can easily be adapted for use with other secondary structure prediction schemes. The use of these programs to analyze protein structure-function relationships is described and evaluated."
539,1988,A computer program allows the separation of a wide range of chromosome sizes by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.,"The introduction of Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis techniques, which allow the separation of DNA molecules of molecular weights as high as chromosomes of lower eukaryotes, has given a powerful tool to geneticists. The resolution expected from these techniques is dependent on numerous parameters, among them pulse time and field strength. A given set of these parameters allows only a limited range of molecular weights to be resolved. To allow the separation of a broader molecular weight range on a single gel, we designed a computer program, driving a simple switching device, to take care of switching electrodes and power supplies in OFAGE migrations. This program has been designed to be used with any technique calling for periodic switching or inversion of the electric field, and/or variation of the electric field applied during electrophoresis. As an example, we show the results obtained with yeast genera in which chromosome sizes range from 260 to 9,000 kilobase pairs.Images"
540,1988,A consensus sequence for cleavage by vertebrate DNA topoisomerase II.,"Topoisomerase II, purified from chicken erythrocytes, was reacted with a large number of different DNA fragments and cleavages were catalogued in the presence and absence of drugs that stabilize the cleavage intermediate. Cleavages were sequenced to derive a consensus for topoisomerase II that predicts catalytic sites. The consensus is: (sequence; see text) where N is any base and cleavage occurs at the indicated mark between -1 and +1. The consensus accurately predicts topoisomerase II sites in vitro. This consensus is not closely related to the Drosophila consensus sequence, but the two enzymes show some similarities in site recognition. Topoisomerase II purified from human placenta cleaves DNA sites that are essentially identical to the chicken enzyme, suggesting that vertebrate type II enzymes share a common catalytic sequence. Both viral and tissue specific enhancers contain sites sharing strong homology to the consensus and endogenous topoisomerase II recognizes some of these sites in vivo.Images"
541,1988,A conserved heptamer upstream of the IgH promoter region octamer can be the site of a coordinate protein-DNA interaction.,"Immunoglobulin genes contain a conserved eight base sequence element 5' to the site of transcription initiation. This octamer can serve as a site for the binding of nuclear proteins which are presumably involved in the cell type specific expression of this family of genes. In studying the binding of nuclear proteins to this conserved sequence element, we have detected a protein interaction that involves, in addition to the octamer, nucleotides which are immediately upstream. We have characterized this additional contact as a sequence specific interaction with a heptameric sequence element (CTCATGA) that is conserved among Ig heavy chain promoters. Protein binding to the heptamer is unique in that it is dependent upon the proximity and orientation of, as well as protein interaction with, the conserved octamer.Images"

545,1988,Acoustic neuroma surgery in Northern Ireland 1976 - 1986,"Forty acoustic neuromas have been removed surgically between 1976 and 1986. The condition was unilateral in 32 and bilateral in four. There were 31 large, four medium and five small tumours. Excision was complete in 16 and incomplete in 24. Of the incomplete removals 14 were subtotal leaving microscopic remnants, eight were partial capsular and two were intracapsular. Follow-up ranged from two months to ten years (median 3åá5 years). There was one early death in an 83-year-old. The overall incidence of post-operative complete facial paralysis was 20% but reached 55% for large tumours when excision was complete. Twenty-eight patients had hearing before operation and in eleven patients some preservation of hearing was possible (39%). In these, the excision was complete in three, subtotal in four, partial capsular in three and intracapsular in one. Of the unilateral tumours, there have been three recurrences requiring repeat surgery. All were initially incompletely excised. Two were of an invasive nature causing considerable erosion of the petrous temporal bone making complete excision impossible. For the bilateral tumours a deliberate incomplete excision was first performed on one side to ensure preservation of hearing. Further excision on this side was then left until such time as hearing was lost. Complications included CSF otorhinorrhoea (5%), persistent but temporary nausea and vomiting (10%), meningitis (5%), facial numbness (5%) and hoarseness and dysphagia (3%)."
546,1988,Acquisition and analysis of GFAAS data,"Since its inception as an analytical technique some 30 years ago atomic absorption spectrometry has become a firmly established method for the analysis of trace metals. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry provides the analyst with the capability of analysis of solutions containing ë_g l-1 levels of the analyte, but, because of the transient nature of the signals, a sophisticated approach to the data aquisition and handling of data is required. Most modern commercial graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometers have built in microprocessors for this purpose but they often have limited capability for extensible user programs and limited data storage facilities. In this communication we describe the use of an Apple IIe microcomputer for the acquisition of data from a Pye Unicam SP9 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Details of the interface which utilizes an in-house designed AD converter, and an overview of the Pascal and assembler programs employed are given. The system allows the user to record, store and dump the graphical display of the furnace signalsfor all analyses performed. Files containing details of peak height, and area are formatted on an eight-column spreadsheet. Details of sample type, concentrations of standards, dilutions and replication are entered from the keyboard. The calibration graph is constructed using a moving quadratic fit routine and the concentrations of the analyte in unknown solutions calculated. In addition to this, greater processing power and integration of the data into other analytical schemes can be achieved by exporting the data to other software packages and computers. Details of data transfer between the Apple IIe and an Amstrad PC 1512 are given. Some examples of the use of the system in the development of an analytical methodfor silver in plant material are given."

The results of these studies, coupled with imino proton NMR measurements indicate that the antitumor drug causes a change in DNA conformation at a distance from the actinomycin intercalation site in a molecule of sequence d[ATATATAGCTATATAT] that does not occur in d[AAAAAAAGCTTTTTTT]. The experiments demonstrate that DNase I rate enhancements associated with actinomycin D binding are caused by ligand alteration of equilibrium DNA structure.Images"
548,1988,Activation of T cell-derived lymphokine genes in T cells and fibroblasts: effects of human T cell leukemia virus type I p40x protein and bovine papilloma virus encoded E2 protein.,"The effects of p40x, a product of an human T cell leukemia virus type I, on the activation of lymphokine genes were examined. The mouse GM-CSF and IL-3 genes were activated by cotransfection with a pX containing plasmid both in Jurkat and CV1 cells. Mouse GM-CSF gene was also activated by phytohaemagglutinin A (PHA)/phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or PMA/calcium ionophore A23187 stimulation. The 5'-flanking region of the mouse GM-CSF gene which is required for activation by pX or mitogen was mapped within 226 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site. Action of pX was not restricted to T cells. pX activated exogenously added GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-3 and IL-4 genes in fibroblasts. Activation of the GM-CSF gene in fibroblasts appears to require the same regulatory region as in T cells. Similar results were obtained using bovine papilloma virus encoded E2 protein. We propose that pX or E2 protein, both in T cells and fibroblasts, activates cellular component(s) in the signal transduction pathway which results in the activation of lymphokine genes in the absence of extracellular stimuli.Images"
549,1988,Activity of the adenosine deaminase promoter in transgenic mice.,"The promoter of the human gene for adenosine deaminase (ADA) is extremely G/C-rich, contains several G/C-box motifs (GGGCGGG) and lacks any apparent TATA or CAAT boxes. These features are commonly found in promoters of genes that lack a strong tissue specificity, and are referred to as ""housekeeping genes"". Like other housekeeping genes, the ADA gene is expressed in all tissues. However, there is a considerable variation in the levels of expression of the ADA protein in different tissues. In order to study the activity of the ADA promoter, transgenic mice were generated that harbor a chimeric gene composed of the ADA promoter linked to a reporter gene encoding the bacterial enzyme Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT). These mice reproducibly showed CAT expression in all tissues examined, including the hemopoietic organs (spleen, thymus and bone marrow). However, examination of the actual cell types expressing the CAT gene revealed the ADA promoter to be inactive in the hemopoietic cells. This was substantiated by a transplantation experiment in which bone marrow from ADA-CAT transgenic mice was used to reconstitute the hemopoietic compartment of lethally irradiated mice. The engrafted recipients revealed strongly reduced CAT activity in their hemopoietic organs. The lack of expression in hemopoietic cells was further shown to be correlated with a hypermethylated state of the transgene. Combined, our data suggest that the ADA promoter sequences tested can direct expression in a wide variety of tissues as expected for a regular housekeeping gene promoter. However, the activity of the ADA promoter fragment did not reflect the tissue-specific variations in expression levels of the endogenous ADA gene. Additionally, regulatory elements are needed for expression in the hemopoietic cells.Images"

551,1989,10T1/2 cells: an in vitro model for molecular genetic analysis of mesodermal determination and differentiation.,"Progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell type-specific gene expression during the terminal differentiation of cells into specialized tissue types. These studies have concentrated largely on defining the cis elements and trans-acting factors responsible for the transcription of differentiation-specific genes. Valuable as these investigations have been, they have not been able to place differentiation into the larger context of development, specifically into the context of the earlier developmental process of cell determination, when embryonic stem cell lineages are formed and the genetic regulatory programs for cell type-specific gene activation and expression are acquired by stem cells. The clonal mouse embryo cell line, C3H/10T1/2, clone 8 (10T1/2) provides a unique opportunity to examine the molecular genetic regulation of both the developmental determination of vertebrate stem cell lineages and their subsequent differentiation. 10T1/2 is an apparently multipotential cell line that can be converted by 5-azacytidine into three mesodermal stem cell lineages. These determined proliferative stem cells are stable in culture and retain their ability to differentiate in mitogen-depleted medium. The most significant discovery has been that 10T1/2 lineage determination is under simple genetic control and that the regulatory genes that mediate the formation of myogenic cell lineages, and likely the chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages, can be demonstrated and studied by genomic DNA and cDNA transfection approaches. This paper is a description of the remarkable properties and genetic behaviors of the 10T1/2 cells and a discussion of the insights that future studies of this cell may provide."
552,1989,19F NMR of 5-fluorouracil-substituted transfer RNA transcribed in vitro: resonance assignment of fluorouracil-guanine base pairs.,"5-Fluorouracil is readily incorporated into active tRNA(Val) transcribed in vitro from a recombinant phagemid containing a synthetic E. coli tRNA(Val) gene. This tRNA has the expected sequence and a secondary and tertiary structure resembling that of native 5-fluorouracil-substituted tRNA(Val), as judged by 19F NMR spectroscopy. To assign resonances in the 19F spectrum, mutant phagemids were constructed having base changes in the tRNA gene. Replacement of fluorouracil in the T-stem with cytosine, converting a FU-G to a C-G base pair, results in the loss of one downfield peak in the 19F NMR spectrum of the mutant tRNA(Val). The spectra of other mutant tRNAs having guanine for adenine substitutions that convert FU-A to FU-G base pairs all have one resonance shifted 4.5 to 5 ppm downfield. These results allow assignment of several 19F resonances and demonstrate that the chemical shift of the 19F signal from base-paired 5-fluorouracil differs considerably between Watson-Crick and wobble geometry."
553,1989,32P analysis of DNA adducts in tissues of benzene-treated rats.,"Solid tumors have been reported in the Zymbal gland, oral and nasal cavities, liver, and mammary gland of Sprague-Dawley rats following chronic, high-dose administration of benzene. The carcinogenic activity of benzene is thought to be caused by activation to toxic metabolites that can interact with DNA, forming covalent adducts. A nuclease P1-enhanced 32P-postlabeling assay, having a sensitivity limit of 1 adduct in 10(9-10) DNA nucleotides, was found suitable for measuring aromatic DNA adducts derived in vitro from catechol, benzenetriol (BT), phenol, hydroquinone (HQ), and benzoquinone (BQ), potential metabolites of benzene. When DNA specimens isolated from tissues of female Sprague-Dawley rats at 24 hr after an oral gavage dose of 200 to 500 mg/kg, 5 days/week, in olive oil (3 mL/kg) for 1 day, 1 week, 5 weeks, and 10 weeks were analyzed by the 32P-postlabeling procedure, no aromatic adducts were detected unequivocally with DNA samples of liver, kidney, bone marrow, and mammary gland. With Zymbal gland DNA, three weak spots at levels totaling four lesions per 10(9) DNA nucleotides were seen only after 10 weeks of treatment, and these adducts did not correspond chromatographically to major adducts in vitro from the above specified compounds. Consequently, this finding requires confirmatory experiments. This distinct adduct pattern may relate to tumor induction in this organ following benzene administration. Our results also indicate that DNA adducts derived from catechol, BT, phenol, HQ, and BQ are either not formed in vivo with benzene or formed at levels below the detection limit of 1 adduct per 10(9-10) DNA nucleotides.ImagesFIGURE 1.FIGURE 2.FIGURE 3."
554,1989,5' flanking and first intron sequences of the human beta-actin gene required for efficient promoter activity.,"We have identified a CCAAT box element that is required for the efficient transcription of the human beta-actin gene. Both in vivo transient transfection assays in cultured HeLa cells and in vitro run-off transcription assays in HeLa whole cell extracts demonstrated the requirement of this element for efficient promoter activity. A gel mobility shift assay revealed a Hela nuclear factor that specifically interacted with the beta-actin CCAAT element in vitro; mutation of the first three base pairs of the CCAAT pentanucleotide abolished binding of this factor. Competition gel shift experiments revealed that three sequence elements located within the beta-actin promoter, each containing a CC(A/T)6GG motif similar to that contained within the c-fos serum response element, were able to bind a different nuclear factor, serum response factor (SRF). One of these CC(A/T)6GG motifs is contained within a first intron fragment that enhanced transcription from a heterologous promoter in vivo.Images"

556,1989,A 10-Year Prospective Evaluation of Balloon Tube Tamponade and Emergency Injection Sclerotherapy for Actively Bleeding Oesophageal Varices,"During a 10 year study period 234 patients were admitted on 371 occasions with a total of 566 acute variceal bleeding episodes. Of these, 173 patients had 343 variceal bleeds which required balloon tamponade to achieve initial control of bleeding during 229 admissions and were then referred for emergency injection sclerotherapy. Sixty-eight percent of these patients had alcoholic cirrhosis and 42% were poor risk Grade C patients. Injection sclerotherapy was performed initially using the rigid Negus oesophagoscope under general anaesthesia and later using the fibreoptic endoscope under light sedation. Definitive control of variceal bleeding was achieved with sclerotherapy during 197 hospital admissions (92%). Of the 17 failures of emergency sclerotherapy, 4 patients died from uncontrolled bleeding and 13 patients underwent major surgical intervention. Definitive control of variceal bleeding was achieved with a single injection treatment in 138 hospital admissions (70%). Complications were mostly of a minor nature and occurred at a rate of 6% per injection treatment. The overall hospital admission mortality was 36%. The majority of patients died due to liver failure. The mortality in patients who required 4 injection treatments to control variceal bleeding was 71%. Injection sclerotherapy is proposed as the emergency treatment of choice for patients whose variceal bleeding continues or recurs after initial conservative management. Patients whose variceal bleeding is not controlled by 2 injection treatments require more major emergency surgery."
557,1989,A 12 megabase restriction map at the cystic fibrosis locus.,"We have constructed a physical map of the chromosomal region containing the cystic fibrosis locus using seven DNA markers and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis methods. The map includes cleavage sites for 8 rare-cutting restriction enzymes and spans over 12 megabases (Mb) of DNA, with one unlinked probe covering an additional 5 Mb. To our knowledge, this is the largest segment of human DNA which has been restriction-mapped to date. We can identify thirteen putative HTF islands spaced at intervals of 0.3-3.2 Mb. The region between loci D7S8 and MET, where the CF gene lies, includes 1.4-1.9 Mb of DNA.Images"
558,1989,A 6-fold difference in the half-life of immunoglobulin mu heavy chain mRNA in cell lines representing two stages of B cell differentiation.,"When B cells differentiate into plasma cells, there is a large increase in the cellular content of mRNA coding for immunoglobulin. This increase cannot be fully accounted for by the increase in rate of transcription of the genes. We have investigated the possibility that the half-life of mu heavy chain mRNA increases during B cell differentiation, by measuring the rates of decay of the same endogenous mu gene in two cell lines representing the B cell and the plasma cell. Using a pulse-chase protocol, it was found that there was a significant increase in the half-life of mu mRNA between the B cell and the plasma cell, and no detectable difference in the average half-life of total poly(A)+ RNA in the two cell lines. The reduced rate of decay of mu mRNA in the more differentiated cell type is almost sufficient to account for the difference in steady state mu mRNA levels between the two cell lines.Images"

563,1989,Aberrant expression of platelet-derived growth factor A-chain cDNAs due to cryptic splicing of RNA transcripts in COS-1 cells.,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a cationic dimer composed of two chains, designated A and B. All three dimeric isotypes of PDGF, PDGF-AA, -AB and -BB, are biologically active but may have distinct functional activities. Two A-chain precursors which differ by the presence of a highly basic 15 amino acid C-terminal extension are derived from the A-chain by alternative RNA splicing. To compare the functional properties of these two different forms of the A-chain, expression vectors were generated in which the cDNAs were placed under the transcriptional control of a viral promoter (pSV2). Surprisingly, cryptic RNA splice donor sites were identified in both forms of the PDGF A-chain which modify the A-chain open reading frame and alter the structure of the expressed protein. Recognition of this phenomenon appears to explain the discrepancies between previous results regarding the secretory properties of the PDGF A-chain and may explain difficulties in expression vectors containing splice acceptor sites between the inserted sequence and the polyadenylation site.Images"

568,1989,Abortive initiation by bacteriophage T3 and T7 RNA polymerases under conditions of limiting substrate.,Initiation of RNA synthesis by the phage polymerases is abortive if the concentration of pyrimidine triphosphates is limiting. Under abortive initiation conditions the polymerases repeatedly initiate transcription but produce ribooligonucleotides that terminate just prior to the first occurrence of the limiting substrate. Abortive initiation is most severe if the limiting substrate occurs within the first 8-12 nucleotides of the nascent RNA chain and is particularly evident when UMP is limiting. The formation of stable elongation complexes (as determined by gel retardation experiments) occurs after the synthesis of an RNA product 8-12 nucleotides in length.Images
569,1989,"ABR, an active BCR-related gene.","The human BCR gene on chromosome 22 is specifically involved in the Philadelphia translocation, t(9;22), a chromosomal rearrangement present in the leukemic cells of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In most cases, the breakpoints on chromosome 22 are found within a 5.8 kb region of DNA designated the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr) of the BCR gene. Hybridization experiments have indicated that the human genome contains BCR gene-related sequences. Here we report the molecular cloning of one of these loci, for which we propose the name ABR. In contrast with the other BCR-related genes studied to date, ABR represents a functionally active gene and contains exons very similar to those found within the Mbcr. Unlike the BCR gene, the ABR gene exhibits great genomic variability caused by two different variable tandem repeat regions located in two introns. All other BCR gene-related sequences isolated so far and the BCR gene itself are located on chromosome 22. In contrast, the ABR gene is located on chromosome 17p.Images"
570,1989,Absolute mRNA quantification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A novel approach by a PCR aided transcript titration assay (PATTY).,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used as part of a new approach to the absolute quantification of mRNA. We describe a PCR aided transcript titration assay (PATTY) which is based on the co-amplification of an in vitro generated transcript differing by a single base exchange from the target mRNA. Identical portions of a total RNA sample are ""spiked"" with different amounts of this mutated standard RNA, converted to cDNA and amplified by PCR. Because the base exchange creates a novel restriction endonuclease site, the ratio of co-amplified DNA derived from target mRNA to amplified DNA derived from standard RNA can be determined after restriction endonuclease digestion and separation by gel electrophoresis. This method gives accurate results within 24 hours and is useful especially for the quantification of either low-abundance mRNA or more abundant mRNA present in very small amounts of total RNA. The low-abundance mRNA encoding 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) in cultured potato cells (Solanum tuberosum L.) was measured in a case study. About 100 molecules per assay could be accurately detected by the new method.Images"

In order to isolate HCV cDNA derived from human material, RNA was extracted from plasma of a Japanese blood donor implicated in post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis and HCV cDNA was synthesized and amplified by the PCR method using HCV-specific oligonucleotide primers. The cDNA fragment, 583 nucleotides long, showed 79.8% homology at the nucleotide level and 92.2% homology at the amino acid level compared with the prototype HCV cDNA. These results provides further evidence to show that HCV is closely associated with the development of post transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis."
577,1989,A characterization of the elements comprising the promoter of the mouse ribosomal protein gene RPS16.,"The elements comprising the mouse rpS16 promoter were characterized by transfection experiments with mutant genes in which various portions of the 5' flanking region and exon I were removed or substituted with extraneous DNA sequence. These experiments were carried out with otherwise intact rpS16 genes transfected into monkey kidney (COS) cells and also with chimeric rpS16-CAT gene constructs transfected into mouse plasmacytoma cells and COS cells. The locations of the functionally important elements were generally correlated with the locations of binding sites for specific nuclear factors, which were identified by gel-mobility shift analyses and methylation interference footprints. The most upstream element, which is located approximately 165 bp from the cap site, binds the Sp1 transcription factor and augments the promoter activity by 2 to 2.5-fold. In addition, there is a complex bipartite element in the -83 to -59 region, an element in the -37 to -12 region and an element in the +9 to +29 region of exon I, all of which are essential for rpS16 expression. The rpS16 promoter has a general architecture that resembles other mouse rp promoters; however, it also possesses some distinctive characteristics.Images"
578,1989,A chloroplast gene encoding a protein with one zinc finger.,"We have sequenced a pea chloroplast gene encoding a protein with a zinc finger (zfp A). The putative protein is conserved in chloroplast DNA and shows sequence homology to the E. coli protein controlling fol C expression. Exposure of etiolated pea leaves to light leads to the accumulation of zfp A transcripts. The accumulation of these transcripts does not require de novo protein synthesis in the chloroplast, although the expression of highly inducible genes such as rbc L requires it. These properties suggest that zfp A encodes a protein involved in the regulation of chloroplast gene expression.Images"
579,1989,Acid fog: effects on respiratory function and symptoms in healthy and asthmatic volunteers.,"Acidic air pollutants generally are dissolved in water droplets. Mean droplet diameter may range from more than 10 microns in dense fog to less than 1 micron at low relative humidity. Droplet size influences the deposition of inhaled acid within the respiratory tract and thus may influence toxicity. To help assess health risks from acid pollution, we performed controlled exposures of normal and asthmatic volunteers to sulfuric acid aerosols at nominal concentrations of 0 (control), 500, 1000, and 2000 micrograms/m3. Exposures lasted 1 hr with intermittent heavy exercise. Response was assessed by lung function tests and symptom questionnaires. Under foggy conditions (mean droplet size 10 microns, temperature 50 degrees F), no marked effects on lung function were found. However, both normal and asthmatic subjects showed statistically significant dose-related increases in respiratory symptoms. In a separate study, normal subjects exposed at 70 degrees F with mean droplet size 0.9 microns showed no marked effect on function or symptoms. Asthmatics showed dose-related decrements in forced expiratory performance and increases in symptoms, most obvious at 1000 and 2000 micrograms/m3. The different results of the two studies probably reflect an influence of droplet size, but further investigation is needed to confirm this. The aggregate results suggest that only mild, if any, short-term respiratory irritant effects are likely at acid concentrations attained in ambient pollution."
580,1989,Acidic sulfate aerosols: characterization and exposure.,"Exposures to acidic aerosol in the atmosphere are calculated from data reported in the scientific literature. The majority of date was not derived from studies necessarily designed to examine human exposures. Most of the studies were designed to investigate the characteristics of the atmosphere. However, the measurements were useful in defining two potential exposure situations: regional stagnation and transport conditions and local plume impacts. Levels of acidic aerosol in excess of 20 to 40 micrograms/m3 (as H2SO4) have been observed for time durations ranging from 1 to 12 hr. These were associated with high, but not necessarily the highest, atmospheric SO4(2)- levels. Exposures of 100 to 900 micrograms/m3/hr were calculated for the acid events that were monitored. In contrast, earlier London studies indicated that apparent acidity in excess of 100 micrograms/m3 (as H2SO4) was present in the atmosphere, and exposures less than 2000 micrograms/m3/hr were possible. Our present knowledge about the frequency, magnitude, and duration of acidic sulfate aerosol events and episodes is insufficient. Efforts must be made to gather more data, but these should be done in such a way that evaluation of human exposure is the focus of the research. In addition, further data are required on the mechanisms of formation of H2SO4 and on what factors can be used to predict acidic sulfate episodes."

This DNA region has been shown previously to be a positive, cis-acting transcription element of the c-myc gene and to bind nuclear factors, including a base-paired ribonucleoprotein. Therefore, H-DNA may be a functionally important in vivo topoisomer where the H-DNA and B-DNA conformers have different transcriptional activities.Images"

584,1989,A common protein binds to two silencers 5' to the human beta-globin gene.,"The temporal sequence of expression of human globin genes during development suggests precise regulation of these genes. Recent studies have characterized a number of DNA sequences within or flanking the human beta-globin gene which are important in its regulation and several proteins which bind to these sequences have been identified. We have found two proteins which bind 5' to the human beta-globin gene. One of these proteins, which we designate BP1, binds to two sequences, one between -550 and -527 bp relative to the cap site, the other between -302 and -294 bp. A second protein, BP2, binds to sequences between -275 and -263 bp. The binding sites for both BP1 and BP2 are in two regions which function as silencers in a transient expression assay using the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. These results and others presented here suggest that BP1 may act as a repressor protein. Negative regulation seems to be an important component of tissue and developmental specific globin gene regulation.Images"

On Northern blots the cDNAs encoding N and B/B' recognize two different RNA species. A comparison of the codon usage, as specified by the open reading frames of N and B/B' as well as results from Southern blots, show that N and B/B' are derived from different genes.Images"
587,1989,"A computer program for choosing optimal oligonucleotides for filter hybridization, sequencing and in vitro amplification of DNA.","A method is presented for choosing optimal oligodeoxyribonucleotides as probes for filter hybridization, primers for sequencing, or primers for DNA amplification. Three main factors that determine the quality of a probe are considered: stability of the duplex formed between the probe and target nucleic acid, specificity of the probe for the intended target sequence, and self-complementarity. DNA duplex stability calculations are based on the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic values determined by Breslauer et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1986), 83: 3746]. Temperatures of duplex dissociation predicted by the method described here were within 0.4 degrees C of the values obtained experimentally for ten oligonucleotides. Calculations for specificity of the probe and its self-complementarity are based on a simple dynamic algorithm.Images"
588,1989,"Acoustical investigation of poly(dA).poly(dT), poly[d(A-T)], poly(A).poly(U) and DNA hydration in dilute aqueous solutions.","Apparent molar adiabatic compressibilities and apparent molar volumes of poly[d(A-T)].poly[d(A-T)], poly(dA).poly(dT), DNA and poly(A).poly(U) in aqueous solutions were determined at 1 degree C. The change of concentration increment of the ultrasonic velocity upon replacing counter ion Cs+ by the Mg2+ ion was also determined for these polymers. The following conclusions have been made: (1) the hydration of the double helix of poly(dA).poly(dT) is remarkably larger than that of other polynucleotides; (2) the hydration of the AT pair in the B-form DNA is larger than that of the GC pair; (3) the substitution of Cs+ for Mg2+ ions as counter ions results in a decrease of hydration of the system polynucleotide plus Mg2+, and (4) the magnitude of this dehydration depends on the nucleotide sequence; the following rule is true: the lesser is a polynucleotide hydration, the larger dehydration upon changing Cs+ for Mg2+ ions in the ionic atmosphere of polynucleotide."
589,1989,Action of a mammalian AP-endonuclease on DNAs of defined sequences.,"An apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) specific endonuclease from mouse plasmacytoma cells (line MPC-11), was observed to cleave apurinic sites in oligonucleotides 9, 11, 12, 39 and 40 nucleotides in length. However, the enzyme failed to cleave AP-sites in two oligonucleotides 7 nucleotides in length. The maximum rates of digestion observed on these short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragments were approximately 1/30 of the rates observed on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). In studies using the Maxam-Gilbert DNA sequencing analysis, apurinic sites in purine-rich regions were preferentially cleaved in dsDNA but not in ssDNA, indicating that the enzyme has a sequence preference on dsDNA. These results suggest that some sites on DNA might be more efficiently repaired than others.Images"
590,1989,Activation of bone marrow phagocytes following benzene treatment of mice.,"Techniques in flow cytometry/cell sorting were used to characterize the effects of benzene and its metabolites on subpopulations of bone marrow cells. Treatment of male Balb/c mice with benzene (880 mg/kg) or a combination of its metabolites, hydroquinone and phenol (50 mg/kg), resulted in a 30 to 40% decrease in bone marrow cellularity. Flow cytometric analysis revealed two subpopulations of bone marrow cells that could be distinguished by their size and density or granularity. The larger, more dense subpopulation was found to consist predominantly of macrophages and granulocytes as determined by monoclonal antibody binding and by cell sorting. Benzene treatment had no selective cytotoxic effects on subpopulations of bone marrow cells. To determine if benzene treatment activated bone marrow phagocytes, we quantified production of hydrogen peroxide by these cells using the fluorescent indicator dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. We found that macrophages and granulocytes from bone marrow of treated mice produced 50% more hydrogen peroxide in response to the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate than did cells from control animals. It is hypothesized that phagocyte activation and production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen intermediates may contribute to hematotoxicity induced by benzene."

HIV-1 leader RNA produced in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase was characterized using probes for antisense and sense-strand RNA. The RNA preparation was free from significant levels of antisense RNA. HIV-1 leader RNA was shown to activate dsRNA-dependent protein kinase in a cell-free system from interferon-treated HeLa cells. Affinity resins, consisting of HIV-1 leader RNA covalently attached to cellulose, immobilized and activated dsRNA-dependent protein kinase and 2-5A-synthetase.

593,1989,Acute lung function responses to ambient acid aerosol exposures in children.,"We examined the relationship between lung function changes and ambient acid aerosol episodes in children attending a residential summer camp. Young females (112) performed daily spirometry, and 96 were assessed on one occasion for airway hyperresponsiveness using a methacholine bronchoprovocation test. Air quality measurements were performed on site and four distinct acid aerosol episodes were observed during the 41-day study. The maximum values observed during the 41-day study were: O3 at 143 ppb; H2SO4 at 47.7 micrograms/m3; and [H+] at 550 nmole/m3. Maximum decrements of 3.5 and 7% for FEV1 and PEF, respectively, were observed to be associated with the air pollution episodes. There was some evidence of a differential lung function response to the episodes where children with a positive response to a methacholine challenge had larger decrements compared to their nonresponsive counterparts."
594,1989,Acute pancreatitis as a cause of sudden or unexpected death in Northern Ireland.,"Utilising incomplete data supplied by the Hospital Inpatient Analysis, the annual incidence of acute pancreatitis in Northern Ireland was estimated to be about 170 cases per million population. The annual mortality rate for the years 1974-1983, using figures obtained from the Registrar-General for Northern Ireland, was 12.3 cases per million. An increase in both incidence and mortality from acute pancreatitis was demonstrated during the study. There was 191 deaths from pancreatitis during the study period and in 27 of these the diagnosis was made only at postmortem examination. Of the undiagnosed fatalities, 10 occurred in individuals with a history of alcohol abuse. Eight of the 27 undiagnosed cases had not sought medical attention, five had presented with a systemic complication of acute pancreatitis, and a further five had only minor gastrointestinal tract symptoms prior to death. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires a high index of suspicion and should be considered in acutely ill patients, particularly those with a history of alcohol abuse, who fail to respond to appropriate therapy."

The interaction of these mutant 5S RNA molecules with TFIIIA was measured by a direct binding assay and a competition assay. The results of these experiments show that none of the bulged nucleotides in Xenopus 5S RNA are required for the binding of TFIIIA. The affinity of the mutant 5S RNA genes for TFIIIA was also studied by a filter binding assay. In contrast to the effect that deleting bulged nucleotides had on the TFIIIA-RNA binding affinity, deletion of the corresponding A-T base pair at position +83 in 5S DNA was found to reduce the apparent association constant of TFIIIA by a factor of four-fold.Images"
599,1989,A DNA-binding domain of human transcription factor IIIC2.,"Transcription factor IIIC2 is required for in vitro transcription of the adenovirus 2 VA1 gene and binds with high affinity to its B-box promoter element which is an 18 bp perfect inverted repeat. Partial proteolysis of TFIIIC2 with chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease yielded a species which produced a discrete band in a gel shift assay with about twice the mobility of the undigested complex. Chymotrypsin-digested TFIIIC2 produced a DNase I footprint virtually identical to that of the undigested protein, but the stability of the protein-VA1 DNA complex was drastically reduced and the in vitro transcriptional activity was eliminated. These results indicate that a chymotrypsin-resistant domain of TFIIIC2 binds to the B-box sequence. We speculate that stable binding requires protease sensitive cooperative interactions between TFIIIC2 DNA-binding domains.Images"
600,1989,Adsorption of organic chemicals in soils.,"This paper presents a review on adsorption of organic chemicals on soils sediments and their constituents. The first part of this review deals with adsorption from gas and liquid phases and gives a discussion on the physical meaning of the shape of adsorption isotherms. Results show that no general rules can be proposed to describe univocally the relation between the shape of isotherms and the nature of adsorbate-adsorbent system. Kinetics of adsorption is discussed through the description of various models. Theoretical developments exist both for the thermodynamics and the kinetics of adsorption, but there is a strong need for experimental results. Possible adsorption mechanisms are ion exchange, interaction with metallic cations, hydrogen bonds, charge transfers, and London-van der Waals dispersion forces/hydrophobic effect. However, direct proofs of a given mechanism are rare. Several factors influence adsorption behavior. Electronic structure of adsorbed molecules, properties of adsorbents, and characteristics of the liquid phase are discussed in relation to adsorption. Such properties as water solubility, organic carbon content of adsorbing materials, and the composition of the liquid phase are particularly important. Evaluation of adsorption can be obtained through either laboratory measurements or use of several correlations. Adsorption measurements must be interpreted, taking into account treatment of adsorbent materials, experimental conditions, and secondary phenomena such as degradations. Correlations between adsorption coefficients and water-octanol partition coefficient or water solubility are numerous. They may be useful tools for prediction purposes. Relations with transport, bioavailability, and degradation are described."

605,1990,A 40 kilodalton rat liver nuclear protein binds specifically to apolipoprotein B mRNA around the RNA editing site.,"Apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 mRNA is the product of RNA editing which consists of a C----U conversion changing a CAA codon encoding Gln-2153 in apoB-100 mRNA to a UAA stop codon in apoB-48 mRNA. In the adult rat, RNA editing occurs both in the small intestine and the liver. We have studied the ability of rat liver nuclear extracts to bind to synthetic apoB mRNA segments spanning the editing site. Using an RNA gel mobility shift assay, we found the sequence-specific binding of a protein(s) to a 65-nucleotide apoB-100 mRNA. UV crosslinking followed by T1 ribonuclease digestion and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the formation of a 40 kDa protein-RNA complex when 32P-labeled apoB-100 mRNA was incubated with a rat liver nuclear extract but not with HeLa nuclear extract. Binding was specific for the sense strand of apoB mRNA, and was not demonstrated with single-stranded apoB DNA, or antisense apoB RNA. The complex also failed to form if SDS was present during the UV light exposure. Binding experiments using synthetic apoB mRNAs indicate that the 40 kDa protein would also bind to apoB-48 mRNA but not apoA-I, apoA-IV, apoC-II or apoE mRNA. Experiments using deletion mutants of apoB-100 mRNA indicate efficient binding of wildtype 65-nucleotide (W65), 40-nucleotide (W40) and 26-nucleotide (W26) apoB-100 mRNA segments, but not 10-nucleotide (or smaller) segments of apoB-100 mRNA to the 40 kDa protein. In contrast, two other regions of apoB-100 mRNA, B-5' (bases 1128-3003) and B-3' (bases 11310-11390), failed to bind to the protein. The 40 kDa sequence-specific binding protein in rat liver nuclear extract may play a role in apoB-100 mRNA editing.Images"
606,1990,A 46 base pair enhancer sequence within the locus activating region is required for induced expression of the gamma-globin gene during erythroid differentiation.,"The locus activating region (LAR), contained within 30 kb of chromatin flanking the human beta-globin gene cluster, has recently been shown to be essential for high level beta-globin gene expression. To determine the effect of fragments containing LAR sequences on globin gene expression, mRNA from a marked gamma-globin gene linked to LAR fragments was assayed in stably transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells. DNaseI hypersensitive site II (HS II), located 10.9 kb upstream of the epsilon-globin gene, was required for high level gamma-globin gene expression. We also showed that a 46 bp enhancer element within HS II was necessary and sufficient for the increased gamma-globin gene expression observed with hemin induced erythroid maturation of K562 cells. These results localize a distant regulatory element important for activation of globin genes during human erythroid cell maturation.Images"

(p62). p62 corresponds to a polypyrimidine tract-binding protein recently described by Garcia-Blanco et al. (Genes &amp; Dev. 3: 1874-1886, 1989). Crosslinking of p62 to the 61 nt RNA was highly sequence specific. No p62 crosslinking was observed with a 60 nt pGEM vector RNA, a 63 nt RNA antisense to the 61-mer or a 72 nt U2 RNA sequence. p62 crosslinking to the 61 nt RNA was competed by unlabeled 61 nt RNA, by beta-globin pre-mRNA containing intron 1, and by poly(U) and poly(C), but was competed to a lesser extent or not at all by pGEM RNA, a beta-globin RNA lacking intron 1, or poly(A). Experiments with mutated RNAs revealed that neither the lariat branch site adenosine nor the 3' splice site were required for p62 crosslinking to polypyrimidine tract-containing RNA. Elimination of the polypyrimidine tract reduced p62 crosslinking, as did mutation of a polypyrimidine tract UU dinucleotide to GA. However, replacement of a pyrimidine-rich tract immediately adjacent (3') to the lariat branch site with a 57% A + G pGEM vector RNA sequence also significantly reduced p62 crosslinking, indicating the involvement of both this pyrimidine-rich region and the classical polypyrimidine tract adjacent to the 3' splice site. The sites of protein interaction were further defined by RNase H protection experiments, the results of which confirmed the patterns of p62 crosslinking to mutant RNAs. p62 crosslinking was efficiently competed by a DNA oligonucleotide having the same sequence as the 61 nt RNA, showing that p62 requires neither ribose 2' OH groups nor uracil bases for its interaction with the polypyrimidine tract. p62 was not crosslinked to double-stranded 61 nt RNA. Q-Sepharose chromatography of HeLa nuclear extract yielded an unbound fraction (QU) in which p62 was the only polypyrimidine tract-crosslinkable protein and a bound fraction (QB) in which, surprisingly, several non-p62 proteins were crosslinkable to the polypyrimidine tract RNA. Yet, when the two Q-Sepharose fractions were combined, p62 strongly out-competed the otherwise-crosslinkable QB proteins for polypyrimidine tract RNA crosslinking. This indicates that p62 may have the highest affinity and/or crosslinking efficiency for the intron polypyrimidine tract of any HeLa nuclear protein.Images"

613,1990,A bovine homolog to the human myogenic determination factor myf-5: sequence conservation and 3' processing of transcripts.,"A bovine cDNA library from fetal skeletal muscle myoblasts. was screened with a 274 bp probe to a conserved region of the mouse MyoD1 cDNA. One positive recombinant, designated bmyf, was found to contain a 1931 bp insert with an open reading frame encoding a predicted protein highly related to the human myogenic factor myf-5 Human and bovine factors are 96% homologous in their predicted amino acid sequences. At the nucleotide level, bmyf and myf-5 are 92% identical in the coding region and 74 and 80% homologous in their 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, respectively. The bmyf cDNA, nevertheless, extends 475 nucleotides beyond a polyadenylation signal common to both cDNAs. Bmyf transcripts are expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle where three transcripts of 1.5, 2 and 3 kb were detected. While the 1.5 kb transcript lacks sequences 3' to the polyadenylation signal at nt 1415 in the bmyf cDNA, both the 2 and 3 kb RNAs contain these sequences suggesting that bmyf transcripts are alternatively polyadenylated. Bmyf cDNA can activate the expression of the myogenic program in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts as assayed by stable and transient transfection experiments.Images"

616,1990,Absence of methylation at HpaII sites in three human genomic tRNA sequences.,"It has been known since the development of nearest neighbor analysis that the frequency of the dinucleotide CpG is markedly suppressed in vertebrate DNA (i.e. less than %C x %G). This suppression appears to be heterogeneous since it was shown some years ago that three vertebrate tRNA genes did not exhibit CpG suppression. We have analyzed 13 different human tRNA genes and found that they also do not exhibit CpG suppression. Because CpG suppression has been linked, to some extent at least, to the methylation-deamination process by which a methylated CpG is mutated to TpG, we investigated whether the lack of suppression of CpG in tRNAs could originate from an absence of methylation. Three human tRNA genes were selected from Genbank (lysine, Proline, and Phenylalanine) and examined for methylation at HpaII sites by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis. The observed patterns were consistent with the absence of methylation at the seven HpaII sites analyzed in and around the tRNA genes, and we predict that the remaining CpGs in these genes will be unmethylated. Since GC-rich promoter regions also escape CpG suppression and since they are generally unmethylated, avoidance of methylation may be a general explanation for the absence of CpG suppression in selected regions of vertebrate genomes.Images"
617,1990,Absence of substantial bending in Xenopus laevis transcription factor IIIA-DNA complexes.,"The extent and location of DNA-bending induced in the Xenopus laevis transcription factor IIIA-oocyte 5S RNA gene complex was determined by the gel retardation method. The electrophoretic mobilities of TFIIIA complexed with restriction fragments of 160, 177, 282 and 300 bp that contain the sequence of the major oocyte 5S RNA gene were compared. In these fragments the 120-bp gene is positioned either in the middle or at the end. Minor differences in the mobility of the complexes indicate that the degree of DNA bending is only slight. To determine the bending angle more precisely, a bending vector system, pBend3, was used to examine the complex of TFIIIA with the internal control region (ICR) of the 5S RNA gene. A 61-bp synthetic duplex corresponding to the ICR sequence was cloned into pBend3. Duplicated circular permuted restriction sites allow several 186-bp fragments to be generated in which the position of the ICR can be varied. Gel retardation of TFIIIA-DNA complexes with the ICR sequence contained in pBend3 indicates a bending angle of only 30 degrees and shows that interaction in the ICR could account for all of the bending found in the complete oocyte 5S RNA gene.Images"

A cDNA clone, designated as C8-2, was isolated by immunoscreening with mixed sera from non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) carrier and convalescent chimpanzees. The recombinant protein produced by C8-2 reacted specifically with sera of patients in the chronic phase of NANBH. The sequence of C8-2, 269 bp, did not hybridized with any human or chimpanzee genomic DNA, and had no homology with those of primates and viruses. The existence of this sequence in RNA of possibly infectious plasma was shown by RNA blot hybridization and by Southern blot analysis of products amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. These results strongly suggest that C8-2 is derived from the agent of this viral hepatitis.Images"

624,1990,A cDNA from a mouse pancreatic beta cell encoding a putative transcription factor of the insulin gene.,"Cell specific expression of the insulin gene is achieved through transcriptional mechanisms operating on multiple DNA sequence elements located in the 5' flanking region of the gene. Of particular importance in the rat insulin I gene are two closely similar 9 bp sequences (IEB1 and IEB2): mutation of either of these leads to 5-10 fold reduction in transcriptional activity. We have screened an expression cDNA library derived from mouse pancreatic endocrine beta cells with a radioactive DNA probe containing multiple copies of the IEB1 sequence. A cDNA clone (A1) isolated by this procedure encodes a protein which shows efficient binding to the IEB1 probe, but much weaker binding to either an unrelated DNA probe or to a probe bearing a single base pair insertion within the recognition sequence. DNA sequence analysis indicates a protein belonging to the helix-loop-helix family of DNA-binding proteins. The ability of the protein encoded by clone A1 to recognize a number of wild type and mutant DNA sequences correlates closely with the ability of each sequence element to support transcription in vivo in the context of the insulin 5' flanking DNA. We conclude that the isolated cDNA may encode a transcription factor that participates in control of insulin gene expression.Images"

Survival was found to correlate well with histological grading (WHO classification).

The comparison focuses on both analytical and statistical view-points. The first discusses a type of the models and the second evaluates the effect from model misspecification by stimulation, assuming that the ZLS model is true."
633,1990,A comparison of the effects of single-base and triple-base changes in the integrase arm-type binding sites on the site-specific recombination of bacteriophage lambda.,"Triple-base changes were made in each of the five Integrase (Int) arm-type binding sites of bacteriophage lambda. These triple changes, called ten mutants, were compared with single-base changes (hen mutants) for their effects on integrative and excisive recombination. The presence of ten or hen mutations in the P1, P'2, or P'3 sites inhibited integration, but the ten P'3 mutant was 10-fold more defective than the analogous hen mutant. The results with these mutants suggest that the P1, P'2, P'3, and possibly the P'1 sites are required for integration. In wild-type E. coli, the ten P'1 mutant reduced the frequency of excision 5-fold, whereas the hen P'1 mutant had no effect. The presence of ten mutations in the P2, P'1, or P'2 sites inhibited lambda excision in an E. coli strain deficient in the production of FIS, while hen mutations in the P2 and P'2 sites had little or no effect. The results with the ten mutants suggest that the P2, P'1, and P'2 sites are required for excision. The differences in the severity of the effects between the ten and hen mutations may be due to the inability of cooperative interactions among Int, IHF, Xis, and FIS to overcome the disruption of Int binding to sites with triple-base changes compared to sites with single-base changes.Images"

637,1990,A computer program for selection of oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reactions.,"We have designed a computer program which rapidly scans nucleic acid sequences to select all possible pairs of oligonucleotides suitable for use as primers to direct efficient DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. This program is based on a set of rules which define in generic terms both the sequence composition of the primers and the amplified region of DNA. These rules (1) enhance primer-to-target sequence hybridization avidity at critical 3'-end extension initiation sites, (2) facilitate attainment of full length extension during the 72 degrees C phase, by minimizing generation of incomplete or nonspecific product and (3) limit primer losses occurring from primer-self or primer-primer homologies. Three examples of primer sets chosen by the program that correctly amplified the target regions starting from RNA are shown. This program should facilitate the rapid selection of effective and specific primers from long gene sequences while providing a flexible choice of various primers to focus study on particular regions of interest.Images"
638,1990,"A conjugation-specific gene (cnjC) from Tetrahymena encodes a protein homologous to yeast RNA polymerase subunits (RPB3, RPC40) and similar to a portion of the prokaryotic RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA).","The cnjC gene from the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila was completely sequenced. The deduced gene product was found to have significant sequence similarity to the yeast and prokaryotic RNA polymerase subunits involved with subunit assembly. Since cnjC is active only during the sexual stage (conjugation) of Tetrahymena's life cycle, these results indicate it may be part of a novel type of transcriptional control. The yeast proteins to which the Tetrahymena cnjC is homologous are the 40 kd protein of RNA polymerases I and III (coded for by gene RPC40) and the third-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (coded for by gene RPB3). The degree of similarity of the cnjC protein to the two yeast subunits was found to be greater than the similarity of the two yeast subunits to each other. The alpha subunit of the core RNA polymerase from prokaryotes (coded for by gene rpoA) was found to have regions of similarity to the cnjC protein as well as to the subunits encoded by RPC40 and RPB3. Regions of high conservation among the four proteins are noted. The significance of these results is discussed.Images"
639,1990,Acrolein depletes the neuropeptides CGRP and substance P in sensory nerves in rat respiratory tract.,"The mammalian respiratory tract is densely innervated by autonomic and sensory nerves around airways and blood vessels. Subsets of these nerves contain a number of putative neurotransmitter peptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in sensory nerves and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), possibly serving autonomic functions. CGRP is also found in endocrine cells in rat airway epithelium. These peptides are all pharmacologically potent effectors of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle and bronchial secretion. Their functions in vivo are less well established. We have therefore examined the effects of inhaled acrolein, a sensory irritant, on three pulmonary neuropeptides: CGRP, substance P, and VIP. Groups of rats (n = 3 each) were exposed for 10 min to acrolein in air (Ct = 510, 1858, and 5693 mg.min/m3) or to air alone. Fifteen minutes later they were killed (pentabarbitone IP) and their respiratory tracts were dissected and fixed in 0.4% p-benzoquinone solution. Cryostat sections were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for a general nerve marker (PGP 9.5) and neuropeptides. The acrolein-treated animals had a dose-related decrease in tracheal substance P- and CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers compared with controls. No change was seen in total nerve fiber distribution and number (PGP 9.5) or VIP immunoreactivity, nor in CGRP-immunoreactive epithelial endocrine cells. It is concluded that the rat tracheal peptidergic nerves are a sensitive indicator of inhaled irritant substances. Their reduced immunoreactivity may be because of a release of sensory neuropeptides that could play a role in the physiological response to irritant or toxic compounds.ImagesFIGURE 4. aFIGURE 4. bFIGURE 5. aFIGURE 5. bFIGURE 6. aFIGURE 6. bFIGURE 7. aFIGURE 7. bFIGURE 7. cFIGURE 8. aFIGURE 8. b"

641,1990,Activating-transcription-factor (ATF) regulates human 7S L RNA transcription by RNA polymerase III in vivo and in vitro.,"The gene-external part of the human 7S L promoter was analyzed by transcription in vitro and in vivo. Compared to the wild type promoter (-178), a -66 5'deletion mutant revealed full activity in vitro but was inefficiently transcribed in vivo. Further deletion to -37 reduced template activity to 50% in vitro and to basal level expression in vivo (below 5%). A DNase I footprint observed around position -50 protected an ATF-like binding site ('TGACGT'). With respect to 7S L transcription regulation, the functionality of this ATF-like binding site was confirmed in competition experiments and by mutation analysis. Furthermore, S100 extracts of cells pretreated with forskolin in vivo to induce the cAMP system, revealed significantly increased transcription of 7S L RNA in vitro, with no effect on a 7S K RNA gene, lacking such an ATF binding site. Thus, the 7S L RNA gene too is controlled by a regulatory element originally defined in class II promoters and represents another rare example where a specific type of transcription regulation in vivo can be mimicked with cell-free extracts in vitro.Images"
642,1990,Activation in vitro of RNA polymerase II and III directed transcription by baculovirus produced E1A protein.,The baculovirus expression system has been successfully used to overproduce a number of different protein products. In this report we describe the construction of a recombinant baculovirus containing the adenovirus E1A 13s cDNA sequence. Infection of insect cells with this virus results in the production of phosphorylated E1A protein. The phosphorylation pattern appears to be similar to the complex pattern associated with E1A protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Purified baculovirus generated E1A protein activated transcription of specific poIIII promoters both in microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes and in HeLa cell in vitro transcription extracts. The protein also stimulates in vitro transcription of the poIIII transcribed VA1 gene.Images
643,1990,Activation of cellular oncogenes by chemical carcinogens in Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts.,"Carcinogen-induced point mutations resulting in activation of ras oncogenes have been demonstrated in various experimental systems such as skin carcinogenesis, mammary, and liver carcinogenesis. In many cases, the data support the conclusion that these point mutations are critical changes in the initiation of these tumors. The Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cell transformation model system has been widely used to study the multistep process of chemically induced neoplastic transformation. Recent data suggest that activation of the Ha-ras gene via point mutation is one of the crucial events in the transformation of these cells. We have now cloned the c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene from SHE cDNA-libraries, and we have performed polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing to analyze tumor cell lines induced by different chemical carcinogens for the presence of point mutations. No changes were detectable at codons 12, 13, 59, 61, and 117 or adjacent regions in tumor cell lines induced by diethylstilbestrol, asbestos, benzo(a)pyrene, trenbolone, or aflatoxin B1. Thus, it is not known whether point mutations in the Ha-ras proto-oncogene are essential for the acquisition of the neoplastic phenotype of SHE cells. Activation of other oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes may be responsible for the neoplastic progression of these cells. However, in SHE cells neoplastically transformed by diethylstilbestrol or trenbolone, a significant elevation of the c-Ha-ras expression was observed. Enhanced expression of c-myc was detected in SHE cells transformed by benzo(a)pyrene or trenbolone.ImagesFIGURE 1. AFIGURE 1. BFIGURE 1. C"
644,1990,Activation of the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifU promoter: identification of multiple and overlapping upstream NifA binding sites.,"The Klebsiella pneumoniae nifU promoter is positively controlled by the NifA protein and requires a form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the rpoN encoded sigma factor, sigma 54. Occupancy of the K. pneumoniae nifU promoter by NifA was examined using in vivo dimethyl sulphate footprinting. Three binding sites for NifA (Upstream Activator Sequences, UASs 1, 2 and 3) located at -125, -116 and -72 were identified which conform to the UAS consensus sequence TGT-N10-ACA. An additional NifA binding site was identified at position -90. The UASs located at -125 (UAS1) and -116 (UAS2) overlap and do not appear to bind NifA as independent sites. They may represent a NifA binding site interacting with two NifA dimers. UAS3 is located at -72, and abuts a binding site for integration host factor (IHF) and is not normally highly occupied by NifA. In the absence of IHF UAS3 showed increased occupancy by NifA. Mutational and footprinting analysis of the three UASs indicates (1) IHF and NifA can compete for binding and that this competition influences the level of expression from the nifU promoter (2) that UAS2 is a principle sequence of the UAS 1,2 region required for activation and (3) that none of the NifA binding sites interacts with NifA independently. In vivo KMnO4 footprinting demonstrated that NifA catalyses open complex formation at the nifU promoter. IHF was required for maximal expression from the nifU and nifH promoters in Escherichia coli, and for the establishment of a Nif+ phenotype in E. coli from the nif plasmid pRD1.Images"
645,1990,Active nucleoprotein filaments of single-stranded binding protein and recA protein on single-stranded DNA have a regular repeating structure.,"When E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) coats single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2 it inhibits the subsequent binding of recA protein, whereas SSB binding to ssDNA in 12 mM MgCl2 promotes the binding of recA protein. These two conditions correspond respectively to those which produce 'smooth' and 'beaded' forms of ssDNA-SSB filaments. By gel filtration and immunoprecipitation we observed active nucleoprotein filaments of recA protein and SSB on ssDNA that contained on average 1 monomer of recA protein per 4 nucleotides and 1 monomer of SSB per 20-22 nucleotides. Filaments in such a mixture, when digested with micrococcal nuclease produced a regular repeating pattern, approximately every 70-80 nucleotides, that differed from the pattern observed when only recA protein was bound to the ssDNA. We conclude that the beaded ssDNA-SSB nucleoprotein filament readily binds recA protein and forms an intermediate that is active in the formation of joint molecules and can retain substantially all of the SSB that was originally bound.Images"
646,1990,Active site amino acid sequence of the bovine O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase.,"An O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase has been partially purified from calf thymus by conventional biochemical techniques. The enzyme was specifically radioactively labelled at the cysteine residue of the active site and further purified by attachment to a solid support. Following digestion with trypsin, a radioactive peptide containing the active site region of the protein was purified by size fractionation, ion exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC. The technique yielded an essentially homogeneous oligopeptide which was subjected to amino acid sequencing. The sequence adjacent to the acceptor cysteine residue of the bovine protein exhibits striking homology to the C-terminal methyl acceptor site of the E. coli Ada protein and the proposed acceptor sites of the E. coli Ogt and the B. subtilis Dat1 proteins."
647,1990,Activity of carcinogens that bind to the C8 position of guanine residues in an assay specific for the detection of -2 frameshift mutations in a defined hot spot.,"In this paper we describe a reversion assay specific for the detection of -2 frameshift mutations occurring within short stretches of alternating GC sequences. We have compared a series of chemical carcinogens that all bind covalently to the C8 position of guanine residues for their potency in inducing revertants in this assay. Large variations in potency are found within the list of compounds that were tested. The most potent chemicals tested induce the reversion frequency by a factor of 10(5) over background, whereas others only increase it by two orders of magnitude. These differences are discussed in terms of the conformational changes that the different C8-guanine adducts induce in DNA."
648,1990,Acute Biliary Septic Shock,"Forty-seven cases of biliary tract infection with septic shock are presented. The sepsis was caused by empyema of the gallbladder in 23 cases and by cholangitis in the remainder. Gallstones were most frequently the cause of the sepsis. An appropriate diagnostic description of the syndrome of biliary tract infection and septic shock should therefore include a description of the underlying biliary disease as well as the term acute biliary shock. In this series, emergency surgical management by removal of gallstones and drainage of suppuration was felt to be the most appropriate treatment. There was a high incidence of gallbladder rupture (10.6%) and intrahepatic stones (53.2%). Of the 13 patients who died, 8 might have survived if early operation had been performed after the diagnosis of acute biliary septic shock was established."
649,1990,Adenovirus and minute virus of mice DNAs are localized at the nuclear periphery.,"The localization of adenovirus 2 (Ad2) and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) DNAs was studied in situ in infected HeLa cell nuclei using fluorescent DNA probes and confocal microscopy. Ad2 DNA was found in multiple foci which were localized along the periphery of the infected cell nuclei. MVM DNA was found in HeLa cell nucleoli which are associated with the nuclear envelope, and when co-infected with Ad2 MVM DNA was compartmentalized to multiple foci which again were localized at the nuclear periphery. The data are discussed in terms of a model for the role of intranuclear compartmentalization in eukaryotic DNA structure and function.Images"
650,1990,Adenovirus infection of differentiated F9 cells results in a global shut-off of differentiation-induced gene expression.,"Previous experiments have demonstrated a link between transcriptional regulatory mechanisms acting during F9 cell differentiation and transcription control by the adenovirus E1A gene. We have isolated a number of differentiation-specific genes by cDNA cloning to determine if E1A exerts a coordinated control over differentiation specific gene expression. The mRNAs encoded by these cDNAs were undetectable or only barely detectable in undifferentiated cells but then rose in concentration upon differentiation. Analysis of transcription rates in isolated nuclei revealed that all but one of the genes was transcriptionally regulated during differentiation. Interestingly, alpha 2-type IV collagen expression was activated by a post-transcriptional mechanism since the gene was transcribed in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells whereas the cytoplasmic mRNA was undetectable in undifferentiated cells but rose in abundance in parallel with other regulated transcripts. Adenovirus infection of differentiated F9 cells reduced the cytoplasmic mRNA levels of each of the differentiation specific genes to near that found in the undifferentiated cell. Of those genes that were transcriptionally activated by differentiation, adenovirus infection specifically inhibited transcription. In contrast, although the alpha 2 collagen mRNA levels were reduced by adenovirus infection similar to the other mRNAs, the control was post-transcriptional since transcription of the gene was unaffected. Thus, the mechanism for loss of gene expression mediated by E1A reflects the mechanism by which the gene was activated during differentiation. Based on these results we suggest that E1A controls the expression of the F9 cell phenotype by targeting a regulatory activity acting early in the differentiation program.Images"

These 2-5A monophosphates were converted into the corresponding 5'-triphosphates. Substitution of an 8-methyladenosine residue at the third position (2'-terminus) of the oligonucleotides increased the stability to snake venom phosphodiesterase digestion. Both binding and activation of mouse liver 2-5A dependent ribonuclease (RNase L) by the various 8-methyladenosine-substituted 2-5A analogues were examined. Among the 8-methyladenosine-substituted trimer analogues, the analogues with 8-methyladenosine residing in the 2'-terminal position showed the strongest binding affinity and were several times more effective than 2-5A itself as an inhibitor of translation."
655,1991,‰ÛÏAdenomatous Polyps Of The Gallbladder‰Û Adenomas oF the Gallbladder,"The finding of adenomatous polyps of the gallbladder is a rare occurrence and an unusual clinical problem. Among 2,145 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease only 9 (0.4 per cent) presented with adenomatous polyps. There were 6 women and 3 men, aged 17 to 70 years. Preoperative ultrasonographic diagnosis was made in only 1 of 7 patients with gallstones, in contrast polypoid lesions within a gallbladder without stones were easily confirmed by both ultrasonography and oral cholecystography in the remaining 2 patients. All polyps were 1.0 cm or less in size and without histologic evidence of malignant change. The clinical significance of this rare condition is discussed, with particular reference to a possible role in development of gallbladder carcinoma. Surgical treatment should be advocated regardless of clinical manifestation when the polyp exceeds 1.0 cm in diameter or rapid growth of the lesion is seen on ultrasonographic follow-up examinations."

657,1991,A bacterial model system for chromosomal targeting.,"A system that permits efficient site-specific chromosomal targeting of foreign DNA on the Escherichia coli chromosome has been developed, using the FLP site-specific recombination system derived from the yeast 2 mu plasmid. The system demonstrates the feasibility of using site-specific recombination for this purpose, and provides a means to gather information on parameters that may affect chromosomal targeting to guide efforts to establish similar systems in higher eukaryotes. In this model system, the efficiency of integration of foreign DNA is affected by the location of the target site in the chromosome, and the structure of the recombination sites.Images"
658,1991,Aberrant expression and function of gap junctions during carcinogenesis.,"Gap junctional intercellular communication plays a key role in the maintenance of homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Reflecting deranged homeostasis in cancer cells, most transformed or cancerous cells show aberrant gap junctional intercellular communication; they have decreased junctional communication between each other and/or with surrounding normal cells. Studies with in vitro cell transformation and animal carcinogenesis models suggest an involvement of blocked intercellular communication in later stages of carcinogenesis. Analysis of expression of gap junction proteins (connexins) and corresponding mRNA indicates that a number of regulation sites are involved in aberrant function of gap junctions during carcinogenesis. Suppression of transformed phenotypes is often seen when transformed cells are physically in contact with their normal counterparts. Some studies suggest that gap junctional intercellular communication is involved in such tumor suppression."

660,1991,A case-control study of lung cancer with special reference to asbestos exposure,"A case-control study of lung cancer was carried out in Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture, the location of a pre-war Japanese Imperial naval factory and present site of a U.S. naval base. Cytologically or pathologically confirmed male fatal cases of lung cancer during the period of 1978 to 1982 in Yokosuka Kyosai Hospital were compared with a control group in the same hospital. Controls who died from causes other than cancer, pneumoconiosis, accident, or suicide were matched by age to the cases. Information that included occupational and smoking history was obtained by interviews with the families of the 96 cases and 86 controls. Major results were as follows: a) The relative risks of lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure and suspected exposure were 2.41 (p &lt; 0.05) and 1.56, respectively, after controlling for age and smoking history, and the relative risk associated with smoking was 6.01 (p &lt; 0.05) after adjusting for age and asbestos exposure. b) The age- and smoking-adjusted relative risks of lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure were 3.40 (p &lt; 0.01) and 1.72 for Kreyberg groups I and II, respectively. Significantly elevated relative risk associated with smoking history was demonstrated for Kreyberg group I, but not for group II, after controlling for age and asbestos exposure."

662,1991,A cell-type specific and enhancer-dependent silencer in the regulation of the expression of the human urokinase plasminogen activator gene.,"A transcriptional silencer has been identified in the 5' regulatory region of the human urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) gene. This region is able to block transcription from the human u-PA as well as the rabbit beta-globin promoters in a cell type specific and orientation independent way. The silencer is enhancer dependent and is active in two cell lines (HeLa and CV-1) which produce little if any uPA, but not in the high uPA producer PC3. Silencing activity and enhancer dependence can be separated: the silencing activity has been localized to the DNA fragment -660 to -536, while the enhancer dependence is located in the -536 to -308 fragment. The DNA sequence of the silencer region contains an element that closely resembles the TGF-beta responsive negative element TIE.Images"
663,1991,A chemical interference study on the interaction of ribosomal protein L11 from Escherichia coli with RNA molecules containing its binding site from 23S rRNA.,"The interaction between ribosomal protein L11 from Escherichia coli and in vitro synthesized RNA containing its binding site from 23S rRNA was characterized by identifying nucleotides that interfered with complex formation when chemically modified by diethylpyrocarbonate or hydrazine. Chemically modified RNA was incubated with L11 under conditions appropriate for specific binding of L11 and the resulting protein-RNA complex was separated from unbound RNA on Mg(2+)-containing polyacrylamide gels. The ability to isolate L11 complexes on such gels was affected by the extent of modification by either reagent. Protein-bound and free RNAs were recovered and treated with aniline to identify their content of modified bases. Exclusion of RNA containing chemically altered bases from L11-associated material occurred for 29 modified nucleotides, located throughout the region corresponding to residues 1055-1105 in 23S rRNA. Ten bases within this region did not reproducibly inhibit binding when modified. Multiple bands of RNA were consistently observed on the nondenaturing gels, suggesting that significant intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions had occurred.Images"

665,1991,A comparative study of the ribosomal RNA operons of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and sequence analysis of rrnA.,"S. coelicolor A3(2) contains six ribosomal RNA operons. Here we describe the cloning of rrnA, rrnC and rrnE, thereby completing the cloning of all operons. Southern hybridisation of genomic DNA with a heterologous probe from the E.coli rrnB 16S rRNA gene showed differences in hybridisation among the six rRNA operon-containing bands. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene and the upstream region of rrnA was determined and compared with the corresponding sequence of rrnD, showing that the 16S rRNA genes are 99% identical. Substantial differences were found, however, in the upstream regions corresponding to the P1 and P2 promoters of rrnD. Southern analysis showed that some of the other rRNA operons of S.coelicolor A3(2) also differed in this part of the upstream region.Images"
666,1991,A comparison of optimal and suboptimal RNA secondary structures predicted by free energy minimization with structures determined by phylogenetic comparison.,"This article describes the latest version of an RNA folding algorithm that predicts both optimal and suboptimal solutions based on free energy minimization. A number of RNA's with known structures deduced from comparative sequence analysis are folded to test program performance. The group of solutions obtained for each molecule is analysed to determine how many of the known helixes occur in the optimal solution and in the best suboptimal solution. In most cases, a structure about 80% correct is found with a free energy within 2% of the predicted lowest free energy structure."
667,1991,A comparison of symptoms between non-ulcer dyspepsia patients positive and negative for Helicobacter pylori.,"The role of Helicobacter pylori infection in the symptom complex associated with non-ulcer dyspepsia is uncertain, despite the presence of the organism in a high proportion of these patients. In order to exclude physician bias in history taking, 18 patients (9 female) diagnosed as non-ulcer dyspepsia, after endoscopy and gallbladder ultrasonography, underwent computer interrogation using the Glasgow Diagnostic System for Dyspepsia (GLADYS). Five antral and 3 fundal endoscopic biopsies from these patients were also histologically examined for the presence of Helicobacter pylori and quantitatively analysed for polymorph and chronic inflammatory cell densities per mm2 of lamina propria using computer-linked image analysis. In the group of 9/18 patients who were positive for Helicobacter pylori, there were significantly higher antral and fundal inflammatory cell counts than in negative patients. However, analysis of the GLADYS interrogation data showed no significant positive relationships between Helicobacter pylori positivity and any gastrointestinal symptoms. These results confirm a significant association between Helicobacter pylori and superficial gastritis but suggest that non-ulcer dyspepsia in patients with Helicobacter pylori colonisation is probably not a clinically identifiable and distinct syndrome."
668,1991,A complex RNA sequence determines the internal initiation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA translation.,"Translation initiation on EMCV RNA occurs via binding of ribosomes to an internal sequence within the 5' noncoding region. To investigate the organization of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) we have determined the translational efficiencies of a series of deletion mutants within the 5' noncoding region of EMCV RNA. Three functional regions have been distinguished: a sequence between nts 315-484 and the upper parts of the double-helical structural domains III (nts 488-647) and IV (nts 701-763). The first one greatly enhances translation, but is not absolutely necessary for internal initiation. The other two regions are indispensable to this process. A sequence within domain IV determines inhibition of in vitro translation of mRNAs with 5'-terminal dependent initiation. It is proposed to interact with a translational factor(s) common to the internal and 5'-terminal dependent initiation.Images"
669,1991,A computer-controlled data acquisition and analysis system for use in the characterization of plasma atomic emission sources,"The characterization of new spectroscopic plasma sources for use in atomic emission spectroscopy often presents the need for information about the spatial emission characteristics of the source. In addition, information about the variation of the emission over time is often beneficial. It is also useful to be able to graphically see, in real-time, the effects of varying a particular experimental parameter. This paper describes a flexible data acquisition system in which an echelle spectrometer is interfaced to an IBM-PC compatible microcomputer. The FORTH-based ASYST software, which proves real-time display of acquired data, allows any point in the emission source to be imaged on the entrance slit of the spectrometer by using the cursor keys of the PC and a computer-controlled mirror. The different acquisition modes of the system are illustrated with examples of two-dimensional spatial profiles of the plasma and monitoring of plasma stability over time. In addition, an illustration of the optimization of the echelle's aperture plate and photomultiplier tube positions in the focal plane is presented."
670,1991,A computer method for finding common base paired helices in aligned sequences: application to the analysis of random sequences.,"We describe a new computer program that identifies conserved secondary structures in aligned nucleotide sequences of related single-stranded RNAs. The program employs a series of hash tables to identify and sort common base paired helices that are located in identical positions in more than one sequence. The program gives information on the total number of base paired helices that are conserved between related sequences and provides detailed information about common helices that have a minimum of one or more compensating base changes. The program is useful in the analysis of large biological sequences. We have used it to examine the number and type of complementary segments (potential base paired helices) that can be found in common among related random sequences similar in base composition to 16S rRNA from Escherichia coli. Two types of random sequences were analyzed. One set consisted of sequences that were independent but they had the same mononucleotide composition as the 16S rRNA. The second set contained sequences that were 80% similar to one another. Different results were obtained in the analysis of these two types of random sequences. When 5 sequences that were 80% similar to one another were analyzed, significant numbers of potential helices with two or more independent base changes were observed. When 5 independent sequences were analyzed, no potential helices were found in common. The results of the analyses with random sequences were compared with the number and type of helices found in the phylogenetic model of the secondary structure of 16S ribosomal RNA. Many more helices are conserved among the ribosomal sequences than are found in common among similar random sequences. In addition, conserved helices in the 16S rRNAs are, on the average, longer than the complementary segments that are found in comparable random sequences. The significance of these results and their application in the analysis of long non-ribosomal nucleotide sequences is discussed."

672,1991,A conserved sequence element in ribonuclease III processing signals is not required for accurate in vitro enzymatic cleavage.,"Ribonuclease III of Escherichia coli is prominently involved in the endoribonucleolytic processing of cell and viral-encoded RNAs. Towards the goal of defining the RNA sequence and structural elements that establish specific catalytic cleavage of RNase III processing signals, this report demonstrates that a 60 nucleotide RNA (R1.1 RNA) containing the bacteriophage T7 R1.1 RNase III processing signal, can be generated by in vitro enzymatic transcription of a synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide and accurately cleaved in vitro by RNase III. Several R1.1 RNA sequence variants were prepared to contain point mutations in the internal loop which, on the basis of a hypothetical 'dsRNA mimicry' structural model of RNase III processing signals, would be predicted to inhibit cleavage by disrupting essential tertiary RNA-RNA interactions. These R1.1 sequence variants are accurately and efficiently cleaved in vitro by RNase III, indicating that the dsRNA mimicry structure, if it does exist, is not important for substrate reactivity. Also, we tested the functional importance of the strongly conserved CUU/GAA base-pair sequence by constructing R1.1 sequence variants containing base-pair changes within this element. These R1.1 variants are accurately cleaved at rates comparable to wild-type R1.1 RNA, indicating the nonessentiality of this conserved sequence element in establishing in vitro processing reactivity and selectivity.Images"
673,1991,A convenient approach to the synthesis of medium size oligodeoxyribonucleotides by improved new phosphite method.,"Improvement of the new phosphite method for the synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides using the deoxyribonucleoside 3'-bis(1,1,1,3,3,3- hexafluoro-2-propyl) phosphite unit has been carried out via the hydrolysis and capping steps, without any side reaction products. The new phosphite unit and capping agent, bis(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propyl)-2-propyl phosphite, is readily activated by N-methylimdazole under very mild condition on a solid support. This operation involves a one pot reaction, which is an advantage over both the phosphite and H- phosphonate approaches. The mechanism of internucleotidic bond formation of the new phosphite method is also discussed.Images"

Both sets of observations suggest that the source of these changes is a DNA-mediated structural response. The nmr results imply the response is transmitted preferentially in a 5'-to-3' direction from the drug binding site. An inequivalent response of the two strands to a ligand-induced conformational change immediately suggests a mechanism for distinguishing the sense and antisense strands of DNA.Images
676,1991,Activation of endogenous retroviral transcription in SV40-transformed mouse cells.,"We have previously isolated a number of cDNA clones that correspond to mRNAs present at higher levels in SV40-transformed cells than in the untransformed parental cells (Scott, M.R.D., Westphal, K.-H. and Rigby, P.W.J. (1983) Cell 34, 557-567). We have now determined the nucleotide sequence of the archetypal Set 2 clone, pAG59, and can thus identify it as corresponding to the env gene of the endogenous, ecotropic C-type retrovirus of Balb/c mice, Emv-1. We have shown that in the subset of SV40-transformed cells that express the provirus both of the proteins encoded by env, gp70 and p15E, are synthesised and that the former is displayed on the cell surface. We discuss the significance of these observations for the biology of SV40 transformation.Images"
677,1991,Activation of IFN-beta element by IRF-1 requires a posttranslational event in addition to IRF-1 synthesis.,"Expression of the Type I IFN (i.e., IFN-alpha s and IFN-beta) genes is efficiently induced by viruses at the transcriptional level. This induction is mediated by at least two types of positive regulatory elements located in the human IFN-beta gene promoter: (1) the repeated elements which bind both the transcriptional activator IRF-1 and the repressor IRF-2 (IRF-elements; IRF-Es), and (2) the kappa B element (kappa B-E), which binds NF kappa B and is located between the IRF-Es and the TATA box. In this study we demonstrate that a promoter containing synthetic IRF-E, which displays high affinity for the IRFs can be efficiently activated by Newcastle disease virus (NDV). In contrast, such activation was either very weak or nil when cells were treated by IFN-beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), despite the fact they both efficiently induce de novo synthesis of the short-lived IRF-1 in L929 cells. In fact, efficient activation of the IRF-E apparently requires an event in addition to de novo IRF-1 induction, which can be elicited by NDV even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Moreover, efficient activation of the IRF-E by NDV is specifically inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor, Staurosporin. Hence our results suggest the importance of IRF-1 synthesis and post-translational modification event(s), possibly phosphorylation for the efficient activation of IRF-Es, which are otherwise under negative regulation by IRF-2.Images"
678,1991,Activation of junB by PKC and PKA signal transduction through a novel cis-acting element.,"The product of the junB gene, a gene homologous to the proto-oncogene c-jun, is a component of transcription factor AP-1. JunB expression is modulated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli, such as serum, growth factors, phorbol esters (TPA) and activators of protein kinase A (PKA). In order to study the molecular basis of this complex regulation, we have cloned the mouse junB gene from a genomic testis library, and characterized the junB promoter. Here we show that the junB promoter is activated by serum, TPA, and activated PKA. Sequences located between -91 and -44 are necessary for induction. These sequences contain a CAAT box, a G-C rich region and a previously undescribed inverted repeat (IR). The IR element can mediate induction by TPA and PKA when coupled to a heterologous promoter, and specifically binds a protein of 110 kD.Images"
679,1991,Activation of proto-oncogenes in human and mouse lung tumors.,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in several nations. Epidemiological studies have indicated that 85% of all lung cancer deaths and 30% of all cancer deaths in the U.S. are associated with tobacco smoking. Various chemicals in tobacco smoke are thought to react with DNA and to ultimately yield heritable mutations. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in lung tumorigenesis, we have analyzed proto-oncogene activation in a series of human lung tumors from smokers and spontaneously occurring and chemically induced lung tumors in mice. Approximately 86% of the human lung tumors and greater than 90% of the mouse lung tumors were found to contain activated oncogenes. ras Oncogenes activated by point mutations were detected in many of the human lung adenocarcinomas and virtually all of the mouse lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas. The mutation profiles of the activated K-ras genes detected in the chemically induced mouse lung tumors suggest that the observed mutations result from genotoxic effects of the chemicals. Comparison of the K-ras mutations observed in the human lung adenocarcinomas with mutation profiles observed in the mouse lung tumors suggest that bulky hydrophobic DNA adducts may be responsible for the majority of the mutations observed in the activated human K-ras genes. Other data indicate that approximately 20% of human lung tumors contain potentially novel transforming genes that may also be targets for mutagens in cigarette smoke."
680,1991,Activation of restriction endonuclease EcoRII does not depend on the cleavage of stimulator DNA.,"The restriction endonuclease EcoRII is unable to cleave DNA molecules when recognition sites are very far apart. The enzyme, however can be activated in the presence of DNA molecules with a high frequency of EcoRII sites or by oligonucleotides containing recognition sites: Addition of the activator molecules stimulates cleavage of the refractory substrate. We now show that endonucleolysis of the stimulator molecules is not a necessary prerequisite of enzyme activation. A total EcoRII digest of pBR322 DNA or oligonucleotide duplexes with simulated EcoRII ends (containing the 5' phosphate group), as well as oligonucleotide duplexes containing modified bases within the EcoRII site, making them resistant to cleavage, are all capable of enzyme activation. For activation EcoRII requires the interaction with at least two recognition sites. The two sites may be on the same DNA molecule, on different oligonucleotide duplexes, or on one DNA molecule and one oligonucleotide duplex. The efficiency of functional intramolecular cooperation decreases with increasing distance between the sites. Intermolecular site interaction is inversely related to the size of the stimulator oligonucleotide duplex. The data are in agreement with a model whereby EcoRII simultaneously interacts with two recognition sites in the active complex, but cleavage of the site serving as an allosteric activator is not necessary.Images"
681,1991,Activation of the cellular transcription factor AP-1 in herpes simplex virus infected cells is dependent on the viral immediate-early protein ICPO.,"Lytic infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) results in the repression of most host cell protein synthesis but produces an increased activity of the cellular AP-1 transcription factor. This increase is paralleled by an increase in the transcription rate of the proto-oncogene encoding the AP-1 component, c-Jun resulting in an increase in c-Jun protein in infected cells. The increased AP-1 activity in infected cells is dependent upon the HSV immediate-early protein ICPO. Thus a mutant lacking the gene encoding this protein fails to increase AP-1 activity whilst an ICPO expression plasmid can specifically increase the activity of an AP-1 dependent promoter in co-transfection experiments. The implications of these effects in the interaction of HSV with cultured cells are discussed.Images"

683,1991,Adenine photodimerization in deoxyadenylate sequences: elucidation of the mechanism through structural studies of a major d(ApA) photoproduct.,"The mechanism of the photodimerization of adjacent adenine bases on the same strand of DNA has been elucidated by determining the structure of one of the two major photoproducts that are formed by UV irradiation of the deoxydinucleoside monophosphate d(ApA). The photoproduct, denoted d(ApA)*, corresponds to a species of adenine photodimer first described by PÌ¦rschke (PÌ¦rschke, D. (1973) J.Am.Chem.Soc. 95, 8440-8446). From a detailed examination of its chemical and spectroscopic properties, including comparisons with the model compound N-cyano-N1-(1-methylimidazol-5-yl)formamidine, it is deduced that d(ApA)* contains a deoxyadenosine unit covalently linked through its C(8) position to C(4) of an imidazole N(1) deoxyribonucleoside moiety bearing an N-cyanoformamidino substituent at C(5). On treatment with acid, d(ApA)* is degraded with high specificity to 8-(5-amino-imidazol-4-yl)adenine whose identity has been confirmed by independent chemical synthesis. It is concluded that the primary event in adenine photodimerization entails photoaddition of the N(7)-C(8) double bond of the 5'-adenine across the C(6) and C(5) positions of the 3'-adenine. The azetidine species thus generated acts as a common precursor to both types of d(ApA) photoproduct which are formed from it by competing modes of azetidine ring fission."
684,1991,A developmentally regulated gene encodes the dictyostelium homolog of yeast ribosomal protein S4 and mammalian LLRep3 proteins.,"We report the sequence and expression of a single-copy gene from Dictyostelium discoideum which encodes the homolog of yeast ribosomal protein S4, a protein located on the small ribosomal subunit and known to play an important role in maintaining translational fidelity. Over a highly conserved central region, the Dictyostelium protein has 78% sequence similarity to the yeast protein and 83% sequence similarity to mammalian S4 protein homologs, the LLRep3 proteins. The Dictyostelium gene encodes a polypeptide 28,717 Da in size and hence this ribosomal protein has been named rp29. The N-terminal sequence of the Dictyostelium rp29 protein is extended by 61 amino acids and 14 amino acids compared to the mammalian and yeast proteins, respectively, and the C-terminus is correspondingly 15 amino acids or 2 amino acids shorter. Although the coding region of the rp29 gene is present on a single exon, a 157bp intron interrupts the 5' untranslated region and unusually contains four direct repeats of the sequence TCAATCT. The gene is expressed maximally during vegetative growth but a second peak of expression also occurs late in development which is restricted to prestalk cells; rp29 is the first Dictyostelium ribosomal protein gene reported which shows prestalk-specific developmental expression. During each round of expression, only a single 0.9kb transcript is produced which is similar in size to the yeast S4 ribosomal protein transcript (0.8kb) but markedly smaller than the mammalian LLRep3 mRNA (1.7kb) due to a much shorter 5' untranslated region.Images"
685,1991,A differentially expressed murine RNA encoding a protein with similarities to two types of nucleic acid binding motifs.,"Using differential screening, a murine cDNA, termed X16, was isolated corresponding to an mRNA which is more strongly expressed in pre-B cell lines relative to mature B-cell lines. The complete coding sequence of the mRNA predicts a 19kD protein with two domains connected by a proline-rich spacer. The N-terminal domain of about 90 amino acids encodes an RNA binding motif including the ribonucleoprotein consensus octapeptide found in one class of RNA-binding proteins and highly conserved from yeast to man. Within the very basic C-terminal domain of about 60 amino acids, several copies of two different peptides are found which are also present in several proteins which bind DNA or RNA. The expression of X16 is not limited to the lymphoid lineage. In adult mice, although the strongest expression was seen in thymus, mRNA was also found in testis, brain, spleen, and very low in heart. X16 mRNA was not detected in liver and kidney. In tissue culture, the expression of X16 mRNA can be induced by serum. The conserved protein motifs and expression pattern suggest that X16 could be involved in RNA processing correlating with cellular proliferation.Images"

687,1991,A directed DNA sequencing strategy based upon Tn3 transposon mutagenesis: application to the ADE1 locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome I.,"We have developed a directed DNA sequencing strategy based upon the Escherichia coli transposon Tn3. This transposon displays little sequence specificity for transposition and is thus well suited to this task. Both mini-Tn3 transposons and sequencing vectors bearing the phage f1 single stranded origin of replication have been constructed. Upon mutagenesis of a target sequence, a population is produced in which each clone has two f1 origins of replication, one of which is at a variable position depending upon the transposon insertion site. When helper phage is added to the mutagenised population, the two f1 origins present on each clone are nicked, dividing the packaged strand into two segments, each of which is packaged into a separate phage particle. One of these segments contains no resistance markers and is lost, whilst the other is recovered as a deleted clone with a single chimeric f1 origin. A unidirectionally, variably-deleted set of sequencing clones is produced, and appropriately sized clones are sequenced using a primer complimentary to the transposon end. In addition to being inexpensive, the method does not require the same degree of technical expertise needed for many in vitro, enzymatically based methods. The strategy has been used to determine 2.6 kilobases of nucleotide sequence in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADE 1 locus.Images"
688,1991,Adjacent pol II and pol III promoters: transcription of the yeast retrotransposon Ty3 and a target tRNA gene.,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae retrotransposon Ty3 integrates 16 to 19 basepairs upstream of tRNA genes in a region where sequences have been shown to affect the expression of tRNA genes in vivo and in vitro. Sigma, the isolated long terminal repeat of Ty3, is also found in this region. The purpose of these experiments was to elucidate the effects of Ty3 and sigma expression on that of an associated SUP2 tRNA(Tyr) gene in vivo. SUP2 pre-tRNA levels were moderately increased when SUP2 was associated with Ty3 or sigma in either orientation. These increases were independent of Ty3 or sigma promoter activity. The presence of Ty3 or sigma also increased the usage of a minor SUP2 transcription initiation site 2 basepairs upstream of the major initiation site and within the 5 basepair direct repeat flanking Ty3 and sigma. Transcription from an isolated sigma directed toward the tRNA gene was observed to extend through the tRNA gene. In contrast to the lack of an effect of sigma induction on pre-tRNA(Tyr) levels, levels of this sigma transcript were increased when the SUP2 promoter was inactivated by a single basepair mutation.Images"
689,1991,A DNA binding domain is contained in the C-terminus of wild type p53 protein.,"In the present study we evaluated the DNA binding activity of wild type and mutant p53 proteins that were isolated from bacterial expression vectors. A comparison of the binding activities of the various purified p53 proteins, assessed by their ability to bind DNA cellulose columns, indicated that wild type p53 has a higher affinity to DNA than have mutant p53 forms. Furthermore, only wild type p53 was able to bind genomic DNA upon electrophoretic protein blotting. As specific deletion of the C-terminal region of wild type p53 totally abolished binding to genomic DNA, it was concluded that the 47 C-terminal amino acids contain the DNA binding region. The fact that the N-terminus contains a transcription activation region whereas the C-terminus contains a DNA binding domain places p53 in the family of typical transcription factors. Our experiments show that the topographical positioning of these domains plays an important role in the activity of wild type p53.Images"
690,1991,"Adrenal Medullary Autografts in Anterior Eye Chamber, Lateral Ventricle and Striatum of Adult Rats: A Long Term Study","The neurobiological basis for the short-term recovery in Parkinson's patients and experimental animals grafted with adrenal medulla is not yet clear. Structural details of the grafted chromaffin cells are also not available. In the present study, autografts of adrenal medulla in the anterior eye chamber, lateral ventricle and striatum of adult rats were studied for 360 days. Though a large number of cells degenerated, a few healthy chromaffin cells survived up to 360 days in the anterior eye chamber. In the ventricular and striatal regions, cells degenerated more rapidly, and a few surviving cells were seen only up to 120 and 150 days, respectively. Degeneration of the cells was evident from the alteration of the cytoplasmic granules, appearance of vacuoles and lysosomes, rapid decline in the number of TH and DBH positive cells and diffusion of enzymes in the intercellular region. Only lymphocytes and connective tissue cells were seen in the ventricle after 120 days, while outlines of a few chromaffin cells and background fluorescence were still evident in the striatum up to 150 days. In some of the intrastriatal transplants, morphologically identifiable Schwann cells were present and, in one transplant, there was evidence of myelination of axons by Schwann cells. These axons were obviously derived from the adjacent host tissue. From the findings it has been concluded that autografts of adrenal medulla survive for only a Limited period of time on transplantation to the central nervous system and anterior eye chamber. Survival seemed to be better in the anterior eye chamber than at the sites preferentially chosen for treating Parkinson's patients or experimental animals."
691,1991,A Drosophila Adh gene can be activated in trans by an enhancer.,"The ability of a segment of the Drosophila Adh gene to produce ADH activity in larvae is dependent upon the presence of a 53 bp sequence (called NS1) located between 289 and 341 bp upstream of the larval transcription start site. This sequence behaves like an enhancer in that it can stimulate gene activity when it is placed at various distances from, or on either side of, an Adh gene. Like a typical enhancer, NS1 does not ordinarily function in trans. However, when an Adh gene lacking NS1 is placed on one plasmid, and a second gene carrying NS1 is placed on another, and the two plasmids are interlocked in a catenane, both genes are active. This finding supports the mechanism of loop-mediated enhancer action.Images"

When subcloned DNAs containing one or the other gene are stably transfected into QT6 quail fibroblasts, the alpha A-globin gene is expressed at measurable RNA levels, but the alpha D gene is not. The alpha A gene expression can be considerably increased by the presence of a linked Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat enhancer, but that of the alpha D gene remains undetectable. Transfection with subclones containing both genes, either in cis or in trans, leads to considerably reduced alpha A RNA levels and still no observable alpha D gene expression. Transfection with deleted subclones suggests that maximal expression levels in this system require the alpha A-globin gene promoter, as opposed to that of the alpha D gene, but that such expression is greatly reduced by one or more DNA sequences which lie approximately 2,000 base pairs upstream of the alpha A gene, within the body of the alpha D gene.Images"
694,1991,Advances in early fetal loss research: importance for risk assessment.,"The assessment of early fetal losses (EFLs) in relationship to environmental agents offers unique advantages compared to other end points for hazard assessment. There is a high incidence (greater than 20% of all pregnancies end in an EFL), and the interval between exposure and end point is the short duration between conception and event, i.e., approximately 12 weeks. In contrast, cancer, which is the primary end point evaluated in risk assessment models, occurs with much lower frequency, and the latency period is measured in years or decades. EFLs have not been used effectively for risk assessment because most of the events are not detected. Prospective studies provide the only approach whereby it is possible to link exposure to EFLs. Recent methodologic advancements have demonstrated that it is now possible to conduct population-based studies of EFLs. It is likely that EFLs could serve as sentinels to monitor adverse health effects of many potential environmental hazards. The methodology will be demonstrated using lead exposure in utero as an example."
695,1991,"A eukaryotic genome of 660 kb: electrophoretic karyotype of nucleomorph and cell nucleus of the cryptomonad alga, Pyrenomonas salina.","Cryptomonads are unicellular algae with chloroplasts surrounded by four membranes. Between the inner and the outer pairs of membranes is a narrow plasmatic compartment which contains a nucleus-like organelle called the nucleomorph. Using pulsed field gel electrophoresis it is shown that the nucleomorph of the cryptomonad Pyrenomonas salina contains three linear chromosomes of 195 kb, 225 kb and 240 kb all of which encode rRNAs. Thus, this vestigial nucleus has a haploid genome size of 660 kb, harboring the smallest eukaryotic genome known so far. From the cell nucleus of P. salina at least 20 chromosomes ranging from 230 kb to 3.000 kb were fractionated. Here, the rDNA was detected on a single chromosome of about 2.500 kb.Images"
696,1991,"A fact database for toxicological data at the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, Japan","The computerized fact database for the toxicity data of chemicals was constructed at the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, Tokyo, Japan (biological database, BL-DB). The BL-DB stores data on mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, and other toxicological tests of chemicals that appeared in the scientific literature. The BL-DB includes information about chemical identification, test system, results of the assays, and a bibliography. The system consists of five modules: data collection, data maintenance, data search, data downloading, and backup. ADABAS is used as a core database management system. Many kinds of test data are stored with the same formats; therefore, users can retrieve data of different toxicological data by the same manner. A user of the BL-DB can use about 50 kinds of commands to interact with the system, and the majority of fields are defined as search fields, thereby facilitating retrieval of target data through many ways. Currently, there are mainly data for the mutagenicity, especially on the Salmonella/microsome assay and the rodent micronucleus assay. These data can be retrieved and used for structure‰ÛÒactivity relationship studies."
697,1991,A family of muscle gene promoter element (CArG) binding activities in Xenopus embryos: CArG/SRE discrimination and distribution during myogenesis.,"The CArG box is an essential promoter sequence for cardiac muscle actin gene expression in Xenopus embryos. To assess the role of the CArG motif in promoter function during Xenopus development, the DNA-binding activities present in the embryo that interact with this sequence have been investigated. A family of four Embryo CArG box1 Factors (ECFs) was separated by a 2-step fractionation procedure. These factors were distinct from the previously described C-ArG box binding activity Serum Response Factor (SRF). ECF1 was the most prominent binding activity in cardiac actin-expressing tissues, and bound the CArG box in preference to a Serum Response Element (SRE). SRF was also detectable in muscle, but it bound preferentially to an SRE. The properties of ECF3 were similar to those of ECF1, but it was much less prominent in cardiac actin-expressing tissues. The properties of the two other factors were distinctive: ECF2 was of relatively low affinity and high abundance, whilst ECF4 bound non-specifically to ends of DNA. The binding activity (or activities) that interacted with the CArG box was found to be influenced by both the concentrations of the other CArG box binding activities and the sequence of the site. Although there was no evidence for a muscle-specific CArG box binding activity, the properties of ECF1 suggest that it could play a role in the expression of the cardiac actin gene during Xenopus development.Images"

Results from this survey were compared with results from a similar survey conducted 7 years earlier. Odors were detected at least once per week by 32.7% of ""high-exposed"" respondents in 1988 compared with 68.5% in 1981, but prevalence odds ratios (PORs) comparing symptom reporting between ""high-exposed"" and comparison-area respondents were greater than that of the 1981 survey for 89% of symptoms. PORs comparing symptom reporting between these two areas were greater than 2.0 for 64% of symptoms assessed in the current survey. Symptoms reported in excess did not represent a single organ system or suggest a mechanism of response. PORs comparing respondents who were very worried about the environment and those reporting no worry were greater than 2.0 for 86% of symptoms. These finding, along with environmental data from the area, suggest that living near the waste disposal site and being very worried about the environment, rather than a toxicologic effect of chemical from the site, explain excess symptom reporting found in this follow-up study."

We propose here a new approach to generate polymorphic markers, based on the amplification of microsatellites at the 3' end of Alu sequences, without the need for cloning or sequencing steps.Images"

705,1992,5' untranslated sequences modulate rapid mRNA degradation mediated by 3' AU-rich element in v-/c-fos recombinants.,"One major determinant of rapid mRNA decay is the presence of AU-rich sequences located in 3' untranslated regions (UTR). To assess for the contribution of upstream sequences on the activity of the 3' AU-rich destabilizing element, we have determined the decay-rates of v-/c-fos hybrid transcripts by quantitative RNA protection analysis. In a transient expression assay, v-/c-fos recombinants generated two mRNA populations via alternative splicing and removal of an optional intron entirely located in the 5' UTR. Both mRNA species were found to be relatively stable in constructs lacking the c-fos AU-rich destabilizing element. Unexpectedly, in recombinants where intrinsic AU sequences were kept intact, only the full-length mRNA population showed high instability whereas the spliced mRNA species remained relatively stable. A v-/c-fos 5' UTR fragment encoding the optional intron was inserted into alpha-globin genes harboring either the c-fos or GM-CSF destabilizing element. The splicing and degradation patterns of these heterologous transcripts paralleled that of v-/c-fos recombinants. These observations unmasked a 5' cis-acting element in v-/c-fos mRNA whose presence is required for the activity of the AU-rich destabilizing element. They demonstrate the important role of interactions between distinct sequences on the regulation of mRNA stability.Images"

For this purpose suitably protected phosphonates have been prepared and oligonucleotides were synthsized on solid-phase. The oligomers were hybridized with their cognate strands. The duplexes were phosphorylated at OH-5‰Û_ by polynucleotide kinase and self-ligated to multimers employing T4 DNA ligase. Oligomerized DNA-fragments were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the bending was determined from anomalies of electrophoretic mobility. Replacement of dA by c3Ad decreased the bending more than replacement by c7Ad. Reduction of bending was much stronger when the modified nucleosides replaced one or several dA residues at the 3‰Û_-site of an d(AAAAAA)-tract whereas replacement at the 5‰Û_-site showed no significant influence [1, 2].Images"
708,1992,"7-Deazapurine containing DNA: efficiency of c7GdTP, c7AdTP and c7IdTP incorporation during PCR-amplification and protection from endodeoxyribonuclease hydrolysis.","The enzymatic synthesis of 7-deazapurine nucleoside containing DNA (501 bp) is performed by PCR-amplification (Taq polymerase) using a pUC18 plasmid DNA as template and the triphosphates of 7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosine (c7Gd), -adenosine (c7Ad) and -inosine (c7Id). c7GdTP can fully replace dGTP resulting in a completely modified DNA-fragment of defined size and sequence. The other two 7-deazapurine triphosphates (c7AdTP) and (c7IdTP) require the presence of the parent purine 2'-deoxyribonucleotides. In purine/7-deazapurine nucleotide mixtures Taq polymerase prefers purine over 7-deazapurine nucleotides but accepts c7GdTP much better than c7AdTP or c7IdTP. As incorporation of 7-deazapurine nucleotides represents a modification of the major groove of DNA it can be used to probe DNA/protein interaction. Regioselective phosphodiester hydrolysis of the modified DNA-fragments was studied with 28 endodeoxyribonucleases. c7Gd is able to protect the DNA from the phosphodiester hydrolysis in more than 20 cases, only a few enzymes (Mae III, Rsa I, Hind III, Pvu II or Taq I) do still hydrolyze the modified DNA. c7Ad protects DNA less efficiently, as this DNA could only be modified in part. The absence of N-7 as potential binding position or a geometric distortion of the recognition duplex caused by the 7-deazapurine base can account for protection of hydrolysis.Images"

Many of the foci in humans showed dysplasia on histologic examination and were considered to be microadenoma (MA). These lesions may be precursors for adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer. Rats and mice initiated with azoxymethane, then fed diets containing sucrose or casein heated at 180 degrees C to stimulate normal cooking conditions, had three to five times more large MA after 100 days than controls. Thus, cooked sugar and protein contain promoters of the growth of colonic MA. 5-Hydroxymethylfuraldehyde was identified as a promoter in cooked sugar.ImagesFIGURE 1. AFIGURE 1. BFIGURE 1. C"
711,1992,Aberrant splicing of Gs alpha transcript in transformed human astroglial and glioblastoma cell lines.,"Alpha subunits of G proteins, which play a vital role in signal transduction, display considerable structural and functional diversity. Point mutations in two forms of alpha subunits, Gs alpha and Gi2 alpha, impairing their GTPase activity, have been detected in endocrine disorders. We report here the presence of truncated Gs alpha transcripts in a human glioblastoma cell line, HS683, and in an SV40-transformed human astroglial cell line, SVG. These transcripts were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of cDNAs from the cell lines. The truncated Gs alpha transcripts, with deletions in the central region of the molecule, seem to have originated due to aberrant splicing within exonic sequences, which did not conform to the consensus GT/AG splice signals. The presence of a smaller size protein of mol.wt. around 25,000 kd in the SVG and HS683 cell lines, detected by antibodies specific for the C-terminal region of the Gs alpha subunit, seems to be consistent with the presence of truncated Gs alpha transcripts in these cell lines. These aberrantly spliced transcripts, if translated, could synthesize potentially oncogenic Gs alpha subunits deficient in GTPase activity. Whether such molecules, with sometimes relatively large deletions, retain some aspects of their function and are biologically significant remains to be seen.Images"

Detailed analysis of the degradation of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) mRNA in this system demonstrated that both natural and synthetically prepared PGK transcripts are degraded by the same pathway previously established by us in vivo, consisting of endonucleolytic cleavage at a number of 5'-GGUG-3' sequence motifs within a short target region located close to the 3'-end of the coding sequence followed by 5'-3' exonucleolytic removal of the resulting fragments. The extract, therefore, is suitable for studying the mechanistic details of mRNA turnover in yeast. As a first application of this system we have performed a limited mutational analysis of two of the GGUG motifs within the endonucleolytic target region of the PGK transcript. The results show that sequence changes in either motif abolish cleavage at the mutated site only, indicating the involvement of the residues in question in selection of the cleavage positions.Images"

To identify the transcriptional regulatory elements of the mouse Ren-1c gene, the promoter regions were fused to the CAT reporter gene and transfected into embryonic kidney-derived 293 cells and four extrarenal cell lines, HeLa, HepG2, HT1080 and NIH3T3 cells. Transient transfection assay showed that sequences from -365 to +16 of the renin gene could direct transcription of the CAT hybrid gene only in 293 cells. Deletion analysis identified two transcriptionally active regions; the renin upstream-promoter element (RU-1 element; position -224 to -138) and the renin proximal-promoter element (RP-2 element; position -75 to -47). Although the RU-1 element functioned as an activator, depending on its orientation, it failed to trans-activate the renin promoter when the RP-2 element was deleted. By contrast, the proximal element alone exhibited a weak trans-activator property. Gel shift assay identified RU-1 element-binding factors in both 293 and HeLa cells, whereas 293 cell-dominant factors were shown to bind only to RP-2 element. Therefore, both RU-1 and RP-2 elements were found to be necessary for efficient CAT expression from the renin promoter in 293 cells, suggesting that activation of the Ren-1c promoter requires combined action between cell type-dominant and ubiquitous nuclear factors.Images"

722,1992,A comparison of several similarity indices used in the classification of protein sequences: a multivariate analysis.,"The present work describes an attempt to identify reliable criteria which could be used as distance indices between protein sequences. Seven different criteria have been tested: i and ii) the scores of the alignments as given by the BESTFIT and the FASTA programs; iii) the ratio parameter, i.e. the BESTFIT score divided by the length of the aligned peptides; iv and v) the statistical significance (Z-scores) of the scores calculated by BESTFIT and FASTA, as obtained by comparison with shuffled sequences; vi) the Z-scores provided by the program RELATE which performs a segment-by-segment comparison of 2 sequences, and vii) an original distance index calculated by the program DOCMA from all the pairwise dotplots between the sequences. These 7 criteria have been tested against the aminoacid sequences of 39 globins and those of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from E. coli. The distances between the sequences were analyzed by the multivariate analysis techniques. The results show that the distances calculated from the scores of the pairwise alignments are not adequately sensitive. The Z-score from RELATE is not selective enough and too demanding in computer time. Three criteria gave a classification consistent with the known similarities between the sequences in the sets, namely the Z-scores from BESTFIT and FASTA and the multiple dotplot comparison distance index from DOCMA."
723,1992,A Comparison of Sms 201-995 and Oesophageal Tamponade in the Control of Acute Variceal Haemorrhage,"Forty endoscopically proven active variceal bleeds were entered in a prospective trial comparing oesophageal tamponade with SMS 201-995 infusion. Oesophageal tamponade controlled 19 of 20 bleeds over the first four hours and 14 of 18 bleeds over 48 hours. SMS 201-995 infusion controlled 18 of 20 bleeds over the first four hours and 10 of 20 bleeds over 48 hours (p = 0.15). No significant differences between the groups were seen in time to control of bleeding, amount of blood transfused or number of patients crossed over to the opposite treatment. Complications in the oesophageal tamponade group were discomfort due to the tube (17 patients) and chest infection (10 patients), while in the SMS 201-995 group 7 chest infections and one episode of hyperglycaemia occurred, with no symptomatic complaints. The patient survived the admission in 15 of the oesophageal tamponade bleeds and all of the SMS 201-995 bleeds (p = 0.047). An intravenous infusion of SMS 201-995 appears to have comparable efficacy to oesophageal tamponade in variceal bleeding."
724,1992,A comparison of the DNA bending activities of the DNA binding proteins CRP and TFIID.,"Protein-induced DNA bending is of importance in the formation of complex nucleoprotein assemblies such as those involved in the initiation of DNA replication or transcription initiation. We have compared the DNA bending characteristics of the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP or CAP), an archetypal DNA bending protein, to those of TFIID, the eukaryotic TATA-element binding transcription factor. By altering the helical phasing between a CRP binding site and the E. coli melR promoter we have mapped a DNA sequence-directed bend in the downstream region of the promoter. This intrinsic DNA bend may be important in the regulation of the melR promoter by CRP in vivo. Gel retardation assays and DNAse I footprinting show that human TFIID binds to the melR promoter - 10 region. Taking advantage of this fact, and using the CRP-induced DNA bend as a standard, we have employed phase sensitive detection to show that the DNA bend angle induced by TFIID is far less than that induced by CRP. Further evidence to support this conclusion comes from a comparison of the relative mobilities of CRP-DNA and TFIID-DNA complexes. These results place limits on the role of any DNA bending induced by TFIID alone in the initiation of transcription.Images"
725,1992,A comparison of the fidelity of copying 5-methylcytosine and cytosine at a defined DNA template site.,"5-Methylcytosine has been postulated to be an endogenous mutagen in procaryotes and eucaryotes leading to base substitution hot spots, C--&gt;T transitions, resulting from spontaneous deamination of mC to T. The possibility remains, however, that a second mechanism involving mispairing of mC with A might also contribute to base substitution mutagenesis via G--&gt;A transitions. Stimulation of the G--&gt;A mutational pathway could involve preferential misincorporation of dAMP opposite template mC compared to C. To investigate this possibility, we synthesized a sequence containing mC at a defined template location. We compared the fidelity of copying mC versus C and the efficiency of extending mismatched base pairs at the mC position using three DNA polymerases, AMV reverse transcriptase, Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha, and mutant Escherichia coli Klenow fragment containing no proofreading exonuclease activity. Significant differences in misinsertion and mismatch extension efficiencies were observed only for the case of AMV reverse transcriptase. AMV reverse transcriptase was observed to incorporate dAMP 4 to 5-fold more efficiently opposite mC than C. Favored extension of a 5-MeC.A over C.A mispair was also observed with a difference of about 3-fold. In contrast to AMV reverse transcriptase, Klenow fragment showed no significant difference when copying either mC or C sites or when extending mispairs involving mC and C. Incorporation of dAMP opposite either C or mC was barely detectable using pol alpha, although pol alpha has been observed to form A.C mismatches in other sequences. While we cannot completely exclude the possibility that dAMP might be incorporated opposite mC in preference to C, our results suggest that contributions of the G--&gt;A pathway to mC mutagenic hot spots are likely to be minor, lending additional support to the model invoking deamination of mC.Images"

728,1992,A conserved DNA structural control element modulates transcription of a mammalian gene.,"The mammalian dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene promoters contain several conserved sequence elements which bind protein, and yet there are other conserved DNA sequences that do not footprint. We report here that mutation of one of these conserved non-footprinting regions increases transcription from this promoter both in vitro and in vivo. We show that this conserved region is flanked by sites hypersensitive to cleavage by methidiumpropyl-EDTA-Fe(II). Furthermore, multimers of a double-stranded oligonucleotide comprised of this region display faster migration through polyacrylamide than control DNA. The difference in mobility is not the result of bending, nor does the primary sequence contain features that would predict altered mobility. We propose that this 'Structural Control Element' is rigid and down-regulates transcription by inhibiting interactions between proteins binding adjacent to this region.Images"

730,1992,A conserved region in intron 1 negatively regulates the expression of the PCNA gene.,"The Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) gene is a growth-regulated gene, whose expression is under the control of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. In previous work, it was shown that the 73 bp immediately upstream of the CAP site and intron 4 are major regulatory elements. We show here that intron 1 also plays a role in determining the levels of PCNA mRNA. Specifically, we show: 1) deletion of intron 1 increases the expression of PCNA mRNA in serum-deprived cells; 2) a 35 bp sequence in intron 1, containing a reverse CCAAT element specifically binds proteins from nuclear extracts; 3) this intron 1 sequence inhibits the expression of a co-tranfected human PCNA gene in transient expression assays suggesting that it competes for positive transcription factors; 4) mutations in the CCAAT region of the 35bp intron 1 probe abrogate both its protein-binding capacity and its ability to inhibit the expression of a co-transfected wt PCNA gene; and 5) the CCAAT region of human intron 1 is highly conserved in the mouse gene. We conclude that the reverse CCAAT region of intron 1 is a negative regulatory element of PCNA gene expression, and hypothesize that its inhibitory effect is abolished when certain protein(s) bind to it and that inhibition is restored if these proteins are competed out by an homologous sequence.Images"
731,1992,A conserved region in the sea urchin U1 snRNA promoter interacts with a developmentally regulated factor.,"The expression of the sea urchin L. variegatus U1 snRNA gene is temporally regulated during embryogenesis. Using a microinjection assay we show that a region between 203 and 345 nts 5' of the gene is required for expression. There are four conserved regions between two sea urchin species in the 345 nts 5' to the U1 gene. One region, located at about -300, binds a protein factor which is present in blastula but not gastrula nuclei. Three other potential protein binding sites within the first 200 nts 5' to the gene have been identified using a mobility shift assay and/or DNase I footprinting. Two of these regions bind factors which are not developmentally regulated and one binds a factor which is developmentally regulated. It is likely that the factor which binds at -300 is involved in expression and developmental regulation of the sea urchin U1 snRNA gene.Images"

736,1992,Activation and repression sequences determine the lens-specific expression of the rat gamma D-crystallin gene.,"Rat lens nuclear extracts contain a factor that binds to position -57 to -46 of the rat gamma D-crystallin promoter region. This factor protects the sequence 5'-CTGCCAACGCAG-3' in a footprint analysis. Binding to this region is crucial for maximal promoter activity in rat lens cells, but this sequence was unable to act as an enhancer when cloned in front of a heterologous promoter. A region directly upstream from this activating sequence, between position -85 to -67, acts as a strong silencer of promoter activity in non-lens cells. This silencing effect is mediated by trans-acting factor(s). Our data provide evidence for two regulatory elements in rat gamma D-crystallin gene expression, an activating sequence active in lens cells and a silencing sequence active only in non-lens cells. The factor that binds to the activating sequence could be detected only in lens cells and may be a determinant of the lens-specific expression of the gamma-crystallin genes.Images"
737,1992,Activation of human papillomavirus type 18 E6-E7 oncogene expression by transcription factor Sp1.,"The human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) E6 and E7 proteins are considered to be primarily responsive for the transforming activity of the virus. In order to analyse the molecular mechanisms resulting in viral oncoprotein expression, it is necessary to identify the factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the E6/E7 genes. Here we define by gel retardation experiments a sequence aberrant Sp1 binding site present in the promoter proximal part of the viral transcriptional control region (Upstream Regulatory Region, URR). Functional analyses employing transient reporter assays reveal that this Sp1 element is required for an efficient stimulation of the HPV18 E6/E7-promoter. Mutation of the Sp1 element in the natural context of the HPV18 URR leads to a strong decrease in the activity of the E6/E7-promoter in several cell lines. The magnitude of reduction varies between different cell types and is higher in cell lines of epithelial origin when compared with nonepithelial cells. Cotransfection assays using Sp1 expression vector systems further define the promoter proximal HPV18 Sp1 binding motif as a functional Sp1 element in vivo and show that its integrity is essential for the stimulation of the E6/E7-promoter by augmented levels of Sp1.

739,1992,Activation of the mouse DNA polymerase beta gene promoter by adenovirus type 12 E1A proteins.,"A plasmid carrying the 5'-flanking region (-1852 to +33 with respect to the transcription initiation site) of the mouse DNA polymerase beta gene fused with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was cotransfected into mouse N18TG2 cells with adenovirus type 12 E1 genes-expressing plasmids. Expression of E1A gene products resulted in the elevation of the CAT expression by 3 to 7 folds, but that of E1B gene product was much less effective. RNase protection analysis revealed that the activation by E1A was at the transcription process. Both the 13S E1A and the 12S E1A activated the DNA polymerase beta gene promoter, indicating that the activation domain of E1A is in a common region(s) of 13S and 12S E1A products. The major target sequence of E1A was mapped within the 10 base pair-region (-30 to -20) of the DNA polymerase beta gene promoter, which overlapped with the palindromic sequence known as the ATF(CREB)/E4F-binding consensus. The results suggest that the palindromic sequence is essential for E1A-induced transcriptional activation of the mouse DNA polymerase beta gene.Images"
740,1992,Activation of the weakly regulated PHO8 promoter in S. cerevisiae: chromatin transition and binding sites for the positive regulatory protein PHO4.,"PHO8 encodes an alkaline phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae whose transcription is regulated by the phosphate concentration in the medium. This occurs through the action of several positive and negative regulatory proteins, also involved in the regulation of other members of the phosphatase gene family. A central role is played by PHO4, the gene encoding a DNA binding regulatory protein. Digestion experiments with DNasel, micrococcal nuclease and 20 different restriction nucleases show that under conditions of PHO8 repression, there is a highly ordered chromatin structure at the promoter consisting of three hypersensitive regions, approximately 820 to 690, 540 to 510, and 230 to 160 bp upstream of the initiation codon. These hypersensitive sites are surrounded by DNA organized in nucleosomes. Gel shift analysis and in vitro footprinting revealed the presence of two PHO4 binding sites at the PHO8 promoter: a low affinity site at -728 and a high affinity site at -532. Each one is located within a hypersensitive site. Upon derepression of PHO8, the chromatin structure changes significantly: The two upstream hypersensitive sites containing the PHO4 binding sites merge, resulting in a long region of hypersensitivity. This transition is PHO4 dependent. However, not all of the promoter becomes nucleosome free. Instead, as a novel feature, regions of intermediate accessibility are generated upstream and downstream of the third hypersensitive site, the latter region encompassing the TATA-box. The available data fit best into a concept that these regions are organized in unstable or partly unfolded nucleosomes.Images"
741,1992,Activity of chimeric RNAs of U6 snRNA and (-)sTRSV in the cleavage of a substrate RNA.,"U6 small nuclear RNA is one of the spliceosomal RNAs essential for pre-mRNA splicing. Discovery of mRNA-type introns in the highly conserved region of the U6 snRNA genes led to the hypothesis that U6 snRNA functions as a catalytic element during pre-mRNA splicing. The highly conserved region of U6 snRNA has a structural similarity with the catalytic domain of the negative strand of the satellite RNA of tobacco ring spot virus [(-)sTRSV], suggesting that the highly conserved region of U6 snRNA forms the catalytic center. We examined whether synthetic RNAs consisting of the sequence of the highly conserved region of U6 snRNA or various chimeric RNAs between the U6 region and the catalytic RNA of (-)sTRSV could cleave a substrate RNA that can partially base-pair with them and have a GU sequence. Chimeric RNAs with 70 to 83% sequence identity with the conserved region of S. pombe U6 snRNA cleaved the substrate RNA at the 5' side of the GU sequence, which is shared by the 5' end of an intron in a pre-mRNA. We found that the highly conserved region of U6 snRNA and the catalytic domain of (-)sTRSV are strikingly similar in structure to the catalytic core region of the group I self-splicing intron in cyanobacteria. These results suggest that U6 snRNA, (-)sTRSV and the group I self-splicing intron originated from a common ancestral RNA, and support the hypothesis that U6 snRNA catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing reaction.Images"
742,1992,Activity testing of alveolar macrophages and changes in surfactant phospholipids after irradiation in bronchoalveolar lavage: experimental and clinical data.,"This study presents results of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) after irradiation to the lungs in mice as well as clinical data. The number of BAL cells, mainly macrophages, lymphocytes, and granulocytes, changed in a time-dependent manner. The phagocytic activity of the macrophages measured as the phagocytosis of microbeads and measured as the esterase activity also showed a strong time-dependent increase during the acute phase up to 21 days after irradiation. The contents of surfactant phospholipids (SF) and sphingomyelin (SPH; as a parameter for cell death) were quantified by HPLC. Both were significantly changed between day 2 and 21 after irradiation. Three BALs of a patient with idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis, who had received an allogenic bone marrow graft after total body irradiation with 10 Gy, showed similar effects in the cellular and surfactant parameters. These data indicate that there are positive interactions between the number of different BAL cells, macrophage activity, and SF and SPH content in the preclinical model of the mouse as well as in the clinical situation after lung irradiation."
743,1992,A CT promoter element binding protein: definition of a double-strand and a novel single-strand DNA binding motif.,"Numerous genes contain promoter elements that are nuclease hypersensitive. These elements frequently possess polypurine/polypyrimidine stretches and are usually associated with altered chromatin structure. We have previously isolated a clone that binds a class of CT-rich promoter elements. We have further characterized this clone, termed the nuclease-sensitive element protein-1, or NSEP-1. NSEP-1 binds both duplex CT elements and the CT-rich strand of these elements in a 'generic' sequence specific manner and has overlapping but distinct single-and double-strand DNA binding domains. The minimal peptide region sufficient for both duplex and single-strand DNA binding includes two regions rich in basic amino acids flanking an RNP-CS-1 like octapeptide motif. Deletion analysis shows that the single-strand DNA binding activity is mediated by the RNP-CS-1 like octapeptide motif and is the key peptide region necessary for single-strand binding. NSEP-1's affinity for CT rich promoter elements with strand asymmetry in addition to its double- and single-strand DNA binding properties suggests that it may be a member of a class of DNA binding proteins that modulate gene expression by their ability to recognize DNA with unusual secondary structure.Images"
744,1992,Acute Calculous Cholecystitis: What is new in diagnosis and therapy?,"The management of patients with acute calculous cholecystitis has changed during recent years. The etiology of acute cholecystitis is still not fully understood. Infection of bile is relatively unimportant since bile and gallbladder wall cultures are sterile in many patients with acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonography is first choice for diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and cholescintigraphy is second best. Percutaneous puncture of the gallbladder that can be used for therapeutic drainage has also diagnostic qualities. Early cholecystectomy under antibiotic prophylaxis is the treatment of choice, and has been shown to be superior to delayed surgery in several prospective trials. Mortality can be as low as 0.5% in patients younger than 70‰ÛÒ80 years of age, but a high mortality has been reported in octogenerians. Selective intraoperative cholangiography is now generally accepted and no advantage of routine cholangiography was shown in clinical trials. Percutaneous cholecystostomy can be successfully performed under ultrasound guidance and has a place in the treatment of severely ill patients with acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely in patients with acute cholecystitis, but extensive experience with this technique is necessary. Endoscopic retrograde drainage of the gallbladder by introduction of a catheter in the cystic duct is feasible but data are still scarce."

Therefore, the effects of single doses of cytokines were studied in dwarf goats. The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of r.BoIL‰öÕ1ë_, r.BoIL‰öÕ2 and r.BoIFN‰öÕë_ on plasma zinc and iron concentrations, white blood cell counts, and body temperature. The i.v. injection of r.BolL‰öÕ1ë_ (1 ë_g kg‰öÕ1) resulted in an immediate fever which reached peak values 45 and 180 min after injection. Compared with fever induced by r.BoIL‰öÕ1ë_, that caused by r.BoIFN‰öÕë_ (2 ë_g kg‰öÕ1) was delayed in onset. Although the biphasic fever after r.BoIFN‰öÕë_ was more pronounced than after r.BoIL‰öÕ1ë_, the reduction in plasma trace metal concentrations was less than after r.BoIL‰öÕ1ë_, r.BoIL‰öÕ2 (1 ë_g kg‰öÕ1 i.v.) did not induce changes in these parameters. The haematologic changes observed revealed a cell type and cytokine specific pattern. The delayed onset of the effects induced by IFN‰öÕë_ suggests that they may be mediated through the induction of other mediators of inflammation."

747,1992,A cyclic AMP response element is involved in retinoic acid-dependent RAR beta 2 promoter activation.,"Activation of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta 2 promoter is known to be mediated by a RA response element located in the proximity of the TATA-box. By deletion studies in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells we have analyzed the RAR beta 2 promoter for the presence of additional regulatory elements. We found that the cyclic AMP response element-related motif, TGATGTCA at position -99 to -92, is able to enhance RA-dependent RAR beta 2 promoter activation. In addition we demonstrate that this element, designated CRE-beta 2, is functionally active as a CRE since it can bind members of the CREB/ATF transcription factor family and, moreover, mediates the stimulatory effect of cAMP on RA-dependent RAR beta 2 promoter activation in human foetal kidney 293 cells.Images"
748,1992,Adenovirus DNA replication facilitates binding of the MLTF/USF transcription factor to the viral major late promoter within infected cells.,"The activity of the adenovirus major late promoter is substantially increased as the infection proceeds from the early to late phase. To gain insight into the regulation of this promoter, we analyzed protein-DNA interactions by in vivo DMS and DNasel footprinting during the course of adenovirus infection. Little or no protein interaction at promoter sequences was detected early (5 hr) after infection but strong interactions at the major late transcription factor (MLTF/USF) binding site and at the TATA box were evident late (12 hr) after infection. Comparison of in vivo and in vitro footprints revealed that the in vivo interaction late after infection results from binding of the cellular transcription factor MLTF/USF. Nuclear extracts prepared from uninfected cells as well as cells harvested at 5 and 12 hr after infection contained similar levels of MLTF/USF footprint activity, therefore the lack of a detectable interaction early after infection is not due to reduced levels of the factor early in the viral growth cycle. Viral DNA replication was required for MLTF/USF binding at the major late promoter. These results indicate that DNA replication participates in the regulation of adenovirus late gene expression by facilitating the binding of a transcription factor to the major late promoter.Images"

754,1993,3'-end labeling of RNA with recombinant yeast poly(A) polymerase.,Two commonly used methods to end-label RNA-molecules are 5'-end labeling by polynucleotide kinase and 3'-end labeling with pCp and T4 RNA ligase. We show here that RNA 3'-ends can also be labeled with the chain-terminating analogue cordycepin 5'-triphosphate (3'-deoxy-ATP) which is added by poly(A) polymerase. For a synthetic RNA it is shown that 40% of cordycepin becomes incorporated when the nucleotide is used at limiting concentrations and that with an excess of cordycepin 5'-triphosphate essentially all the RNA becomes modified at its 3'-end. The reaction is complete within minutes and the RNA product is uniform and suitable for sequence analysis. The efficiency of labeling varies with different RNA-molecules and is different from RNA ligase. Poly(A) polymerase preferentially labels longer RNA-molecules whereas short RNA-molecules are labeled more efficiently by T4 RNA ligase.Images
755,1993,3' truncated tRNAArg is essential for in vitro specific cleavage of partially synthesized mouse 18S rRNA.,"In vitro synthesized 5' portions of mouse 18S rRNA are cleaved efficiently at a specific site in partially purified extracts of mouse FM3A cells and several mouse tissues. This activity is composed of both protein and RNA, and can be reconstituted with the protein component in micrococcal nuclease-treated extracts and the RNA component in phenol-treated ones. The RNA component of about 65 nucleotides with the complementing activity was purified from total RNA in the partially purified FM3A cell extracts by polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses. Chemical sequencing of this RNA elucidated that it is tRNAArg lacking nine nucleotides from its 3' terminus. Ribonuclease H treatment directed by deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to tRNAArg completely abolishes the cleavage activity, supporting the above conclusion.Images"
756,1993,"4'-Thio-oligo-beta-D-ribonucleotides: synthesis of beta-4'-thio-oligouridylates, nuclease resistance, base pairing properties, and interaction with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.","We present the synthesis and the study of properties of a new series of modified oligonucleotides, namely 4'-thio-oligo-beta-D-ribonucleotides (4'-S-RNA). Homo-oligonucleotides of this class (4'-SU6 and 4'-SU12) were prepared from the previously known thionucleosides using the phosphoramidite methodology. The comparison of the substrate properties of 4'-SU6 and its natural analog U6 with respect to four nucleases indicates that the former is much more resistant than the latter. Such resistance to nucleases in addition to relatively high Tm values for 4'-SU12 hybridized with Poly(A) show that these new 4'-S-RNA are good candidates for potential antisense effects. The oligonucleotides 4'-SU6 and 4'-SU12 have been also evaluated as non sequence specific inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. All available evidences, based primarily on fluorescence measurements, are consistent with the binding of 4'-SU6 and 4'-SU12 to RT at a site which is different from the polymerase site of the enzyme."
757,1993,5' and 3' untranslated regions of pestivirus genome: primary and secondary structure analyses.,"Within the conserved 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the pestivirus genome three highly variable regions were identified. Preceding the polyprotein start codon, multiple cryptic AUG codons and several small open reading frames are characteristic for all the five pestiviruses. Inspection of the context of AUGs revealed that the polyprotein initiation AUG of pestivirus has a weak context for efficient translation initiation. The most favorable context was found in two of the cryptic AUGs. Two oligopyrimidine-rich tracts upstream to the conserved either cryptic or authentic AUG in the 5'-UTR of pestivirus were identified and 83.3% of their nucleotide sequences are complementary to the consensus sequence at the 3' terminus of eucaryotic 18S rRNA. A secondary structure model for the 5'-UTR of pestivirus was predicted. Nucleotide sequence comparison among five pestiviruses led to the identification of a variable region and a conserved region in the 3'-UTR. A deletion of 41 nucleotides was found within the variable region in Osloss. A secondary structure model for the 3'-UTR was also predicted. The structural similarity of the 5'-UTR between pestiviruses and picornaviruses and hepatitis C viruses was demonstrated and the possible implications of features of the 5' and 3'-UTR of pestiviruses are discussed."
758,1993,6-[18F]Fluoro-L-DOPA and Cerebral Blood Flow in Unilaterally MPTP-Treated Monkeys,"Intravenous administration of 15O-labeled water and 6-[18F]-L-fluorodopa were used to assess abnormal striatal activity in monkeys after long-term recovery of unilateral lesions of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal system induced by the neurotoxin MPTP. PET data were examined in relation to behavioral and biological parameters. Cerebral blood flow and 6-[18F]-L-DOPA uptake were found to be significantly reduced in the lesioned striatum, compared to the unaffected side and to normal controls. There was no correlation between cerebral blood flow and any of the behavioral parameters. The uptake rate constant of 18F-DOPA from blood to striatum and the ratios of striatum to occipital areas were highly correlated to the concentrations of homovanillic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid of the same animals but not to the rotational behavior. This MPTP-inducedmodei of striatal dopamine deficiency in primates presents similarities with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and may be used to evaluate the effects of dopaminergic lesions and transplants on brain function."

Biol. Chem. 266: 22493-22500, 1991] has been isolated from a monkey cell cDNA library. The presence of this protein in complexes bound to UV-damaged DNA was confirmed by immunoblotting. The human cognate of the UV-DDB gene was localized to chromosome 11. UV-DDB mRNA was expressed in all human tissues examined, including cells from two patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (group E) that are deficient in UV-DDB activity, which suggests that the binding defect in these cells may reside in a dysfunctional UV-DDB protein. Database searches have revealed significant homology of the UV-DDB protein sequence with partial sequences of yet uncharacterized proteins from Dictyostelium discoideum (44% identity over 529 amino acids) and Oryza sativa (54% identity over 74 residues). According to our results, the UV-DDB polypeptide belongs to a highly conserved, structurally novel family of proteins that may be involved in the early steps of the UV response, e.g., DNA damage recognition.Images"
761,1993,A 39-year follow-up of the U.K. oil refinery and distribution center studies: results for kidney cancer and leukemia.,"This paper presents briefly some of the principal results of a mortality analysis of a cohort of workers employed for at least 1 year between 1950 and 1975 at eight oil refineries and approximately 750 distribution centers in the U.K., together with detailed results for kidney cancer and leukemia. Over 99% of the workers were successfully traced. Their mortality was compared with that of all males in the national population. The mortality from all causes of death is lower than that of the comparison population in both studies, and reduced mortality is also found for many of the major nonmalignant causes of death. In the refinery study, some increased mortality patterns are found for diseases of the arteries, and no healthy worker effect is found in the distribution center study for ischemic heart disease. Mortality from all neoplasms is lower than expected overall in both studies, largely due to a deficit of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung. Mortality from malignant neoplasm of the kidney is increased overall in the distribution center study, and in drivers in particular. The mortality from this disease increases with increased time since first exposure. The observed deaths from leukemia are slightly less than expected in the refinery study and slightly more than expected in the distribution center study. One refinery shows increased mortality due to in myeloid leukemia, and mortality is increased among refinery operators. Mortality is also raised in distribution center drivers, particularly for myeloid leukemias, including acute myeloid leukemia."
762,1993,A base-paired hairpin structure essential for the functional priming signal for DNA replication of the broad host range plasmid RSF1010.,"The two single-strand DNA initiation signals, ssiA(RSF1010) and ssiB(RSF1010) of the broad host-range plasmid RSF1010 contain proposed stem-loop structures. Nine single base-change mutations in the stem of the ssiA structure, each of which destroyed a relevant base pairing, damaged the ssiA activity. A second single-base change was introduced into each of the nine ssiA mutants in such a way that the base pairing was restored. Only three out of nine second base changes that restored the base pairing restored the ssiA activity up to the wild-type level. Thus, the three are intramolecular suppressors. The results strongly suggested that, in the area of the stem of ssiA where the suppressor mutations fell, base pairing was the most important structural parameter for the ssiA activity. By contrast, it is most probable that, in the other part of the stem of ssiA, both base-pairing and the intrinsic base sequence were the major determinants of the ssiA activity."
763,1993,Abdominal Wound Problems After Hysterectomy With Electrocautery vs. Scalpel Subcutaneous Incision,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between postoperative abdominal incision problems and opening subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery or scalpel. Women scheduled for elective abdominal hysterectomy who gave informed consent were randomly assigned to subcutaneous abdominal wall tissue incision by electrocautery or scalpel. Postoperative abdominal wound problem diagnoses included seroma, hematoma, infection, or dehiscence without identifiable etiology. Fifteen of 380 women (3.9%) developed a wound problem; six had scalpel and nine had electrosurgical subcutaneous incisions (P = 0.4). Thicker subcutaneous tissues (P = 0.04) and concurrent pelvic infection (P &lt; 0.001) were significant risk factors for postoperative wound problems. Only two women (0.5%) developed an infection. We conclude that the method of subcutaneous tissue incision was unrelated to the development of postoperative abdominal incision problems in 380 women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy."
764,1993,Abnormal chromosome repair and risk of developing cancer.,"Several scientists have proposed that DNA repair deficiencies and the induction of a mutator phenotype are responsible for the generation of multiple mutagenic alterations in cancer cells. I propose that exposure to environmental carcinogens can induce DNA lesions, elicit infidelity of DNA repair, and cause the instability phenomenon and the subsequent consequences. Using cell lines derived from mammary glands of irradiated mice, my laboratory conducted sequential studies to document genetic events leading to the development of malignant cells in vitro. We found that aneuploidy and extensive chromosome breaks and rearrangements occurred early. This is followed by inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, amplification of the myc oncogene, and expression of the tumorigenic phenotype. Our observation of chromosome instability at the early phase of transformation is consistent with the mutator phenotype. We suggest that a cause of the instability is infidelity of DNA repair, and we have developed a challenge assay to elucidate this phenomenon. In this assay, cells are challenged to repair radiation-induced DNA lesions. In one of our studies, lymphocytes from cigarette smokers and nonsmokers were exposed to gamma rays in vitro. Cells from smokers had significantly more rearranged chromosomes than cells from nonsmokers after the challenge. These data suggest that smokers have infidelity of DNA repair and that this repair problem is a cause of health effects in smokers. In an in vitro study, lymphocytes were exposed to mitomycin C or to nickel acetate and then irradiated with gamma rays. Significantly increased frequencies of rearranged chromosomes were detected with low doses of mitomycin C and nickel, which do not cause chromosome damage by themselves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

766,1993,A brief survey of butadiene health effects: a role for metabolic differences.,"1,3-Butadiene is a major monomer in the rubber and plastics industry and is one of the highest-production industrial chemicals in the United States. Although not highly acutely toxic to rodents, inhalation of concentrations as low as 6.25 ppm causes tumors in mice. Butadiene is oncogenic in rats, but much higher exposure concentrations are required than in mice. Chronic toxicity targets the gonads and hematopoietic system. Butadiene is also a potent mutagen and clastogen. Differences in the absorption, distribution, and elimination of butadiene appear to be relatively minor between rats and mice, although mice do retain more butadiene and its metabolites after exposure to the same concentration and have a higher rate of metabolic elimination. Recent studies have demonstrated that major species differences appear to occur in the rate of detoxication of the primary metabolite, 3-epoxybutene (butadiene monoepoxide [BDMO]). Mice have the greatest rate of production of BDMO as compared to other species, but the rate of removal of BDMO appears to be less than in other species. Mice have low levels of epoxide hydrolase; rats have intermediate levels; monkeys and humans appear to have high levels of this detoxifying enzyme. Thus, while only low levels of butadiene exposure may result in an accumulation of BDMO in the mouse, much higher levels would be required to result in an elevation of circulating BDMO in other species. The level of this reactive metabolite may be correlated with the species differences in butadiene sensitivity."
767,1993,Absence of morphologic correlation between chemical toxicity and chemical carcinogenesis.,"The experimental data set used to evaluate site-specific histopathologic correspondence between the morphologic end points of toxicity and carcinogenicity comprises 130 chemical carcinogenesis studies. Nearly 1500 sex-species-exposure-group experiments were evaluated for a) evidence of toxicity or/and carcinogenicity, b) dose-response relationships, c) site-specific correlations of toxicity and carcinogenicity, and d) correspondence with Salmonella mutagenicity. The major conclusions are that chemicals evaluated for long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity in experimental animals divide typically and consistently into three categories: a) chemicals causing organ toxicity without cancer, b) chemicals causing site-specific cancer with no associated toxicity, and c) chemicals causing both toxicity and cancer in the same organ. Few chemicals overall (and none in this data set) fit the remaining group that cause neither toxicity nor carcinogenicity under these protocol conditions. Mutagenicity exhibited no consistent pattern with any of these groupings. Only 7 of 53 ""positive"" chemicals had target organ toxicity at all sites of carcinogenicity. Just three chemicals showed carcinogenic effects at the highest exposure concentrations without supporting evidence of tumors at the lower levels. From these comparative morphological analyses, and for almost all cases, available data do not support a correlation between chemically induced toxicity or regenerative phenomena and carcinogenicity. Consequently, until scientific knowledge about molecular mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis becomes better understood and generally accepted, attempts to use toxicity findings to modify risk assessment processes will be fraught with uncertainty and thus could have a negative impact on public health."

772,1993,Accelerated poly(A) loss and mRNA stabilization are independent effects of protein synthesis inhibition on alpha-tubulin mRNA in Chlamydomonas.,"In Chlamydomonas, the usual rapid degradation of tubulin mRNAs induced by flagellar amputation is prevented by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. Evidence is presented that the ability of cycloheximide to stabilize alpha-tubulin mRNA depends on the time of addition. Addition of cycloheximide to cells before induction strongly stabilizes the induced mRNAs, while addition after their synthesis stabilizes them only transiently. Moreover, cycloheximide inhibition does not stabilize the same alpha-tubulin mRNA species in uninduced cells. These results suggest that cycloheximide is not acting to stabilize the induced alpha-tubulin mRNAs simply by preventing ribosome translocation. The stabilized state of tubulin mRNA was found to correlate with its occurrence on smaller polysomes but larger EDTA-released mRNP particles than the unstable state. A second effect of cycloheximide on the metabolism of induced tubulin mRNAs is to accelerate complete poly(A) removal. This effect of cycloheximide inhibition, unlike stabilization, occurs whenever cycloheximide is added to cells, and appears unrelated to stabilization. The effect is shown to be mRNA-specific; poly(A)-shortening on the rbcS2 mRNA is not altered in the presence of cycloheximide, nor do completely deadenylated molecules accumulate. Experiments in which cells were released from cycloheximide inhibition suggest that deadenylated alpha-tubulin mRNAs may be less stable than their polyadenylated counterparts during active translation.Images"
773,1993,Accumulation of O6-methylguanine in human DNA after therapeutic exposure to methylating agents and its relationship with biological effects.,"O6-Methylguanine has been measured in peripheral blood leukocytes of 14 patients during one or more cycles of treatment with procarbazine (daily treatment for 10 days) and in 12 patients during one or more cycles of treatment with dacarbazine (single dose per cycle). Adduct formation at levels up to about 0.4 fmole/microgram DNA was detected in all procarbazine- and all but one dacarbazine-treated patients at some point after treatment. O6-Methylguanine accumulated during procarbazine treatment in a dose-related manner (mean rate of accumulation 2.8 x 10(-4) fmole/microgram DNA per mg/m2 dose) and appeared to approach a plateau by the end of the cycle (above 600 mg/m2 cumulative dose). The average rate of O6-methylguanine formation 2 hr after dacarbazine treatment was 11 +/- 8 x 10(-4) fmole/microgram DNA per mg/m2 dose. Individuals examined on more than one treatment cycle with either drug showed broadly similar methylation responses. The rate of adduct accumulation showed a nonsignificant, negative correlation with the pretreatment lymphocyte levels of the repair enzyme O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) in the case of procarbazine and no correlation in the case of dacarbazine. No consistent lymphocyte AGT depletion was noted as a result of treatment with either drug. No correlation between O6-methylguanine formation and hematological toxicity was observed. In eight patients showing full remission after treatment with dacarbazine, the value of O6-methylguanine (averaged over all the cycles) was 0.252 +/- 0.120 fmole/microgram DNA while in four patients showing partial or no response it was 0.087 +/- 0.110 fmole/microgram DNA (p &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

High expression of the chicken Rad51 gene was found within the organs of lymphoid and germ cell development suggesting its involvement in lymphoid and meiotic recombination.Images"

Trans-cleavage activity of the circular HDV-like ribozyme was comparable to linear permutations of HDV ribozymes containing the same core sequence, and was shown not to be due to linear contaminants in the circular ribozyme preparation. In nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from HeLa cells, the circular ribozyme had enhanced resistance to nuclease degradation relative to a linear form of the ribozyme, suggesting that circularization may be a viable alternative to chemical modification as a means of stabilizing ribozymes against nuclease degradation.Images"
777,1993,‰ÛÏClip-Stone‰Û Filiation Within the Biliary Tract,"A case of cholangitis due to the migration of a metal clip used for surgical cholecystectomy 4 years earlier, is reported. The diagnostic approach and therapeutic options, either endoscopic or surgical are discussed. The use of resorbable clips during the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy should avoid this type of complication."
778,1993,A closely related group of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from double-stranded RNA viruses.,"Probably one of the first proteinaceous enzymes was an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). Although there are several conserved motifs present in the RDRPs of most positive and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, the RDRPs of the dsRNA viruses show no detectable sequence similarity outside the conserved motifs. There is now, however, a group of dsRNA viruses of lower eucaryotes whose RDRPs are detectably similar. The origin of this sequence similarity appears to be common descent from one or more noninfectious viruses of a progenitor cell, an origin that predates the differentiation of protozoans and fungi. The cause of this preservation of sequence appears to be constraints placed on the RDRP by the life-style of these viruses--the maintenance of a stable, persistent, noninfectious state."
779,1993,A common set of conserved motifs in a vast variety of putative nucleic acid-dependent ATPases including MCM proteins involved in the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication.,"A new superfamily of (putative) DNA-dependent ATPases is described that includes the ATPase domains of prokaryotic NtrC-related transcription regulators, MCM proteins involved in the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication, and a group of uncharacterized bacterial and chloroplast proteins. MCM proteins are shown to contain a modified form of the ATP-binding motif and are predicted to mediate ATP-dependent opening of double-stranded DNA in the replication origins. In a second line of investigation, it is demonstrated that the products of unidentified open reading frames from Marchantia mitochondria and from yeast, and a domain of a baculovirus protein involved in viral DNA replication are related to the superfamily III of DNA and RNA helicases that previously has been known to include only proteins of small viruses. Comparison of the multiple alignments showed that the proteins of the NtrC superfamily and the helicases of superfamily III share three related sequence motifs tightly packed in the ATPase domain that consists of 100-150 amino acid residues. A similar array of conserved motifs is found in the family of DnaA-related ATPases. It is hypothesized that the three large groups of nucleic acid-dependent ATPases have similar structure of the core ATPase domain and have evolved from a common ancestor."

783,1993,A complex twintron is excised as four individual introns.,Twintrons are introns-within-introns excised by sequential splicing reactions. A new type of complex twintron comprised of four individual group III introns has been characterized. The external intron is interrupted by an internal intron containing two additional introns. This 434 nt complex twintron within a Euglena gracilis chloroplast ribosomal protein gene is excised by four sequential splicing reactions. Two of the splicing reactions utilize multiple 5'- and/or 3'-splice sites. These findings are evidence that introns with multiple active splice sites can be formed by the repeated insertion of introns into existing introns.Images
784,1993,A correlation between dexamethasone inducibility and basal expression levels of retroviral vector proviruses.,"Identical transcription units inserted at different positions of mammalian chromosomes may vary widely in transcriptional activity. We have used a set of ten cell clones with random unselected single integrations of retroviral vectors to study such position effects. The vector used carries a neo gene driven by the Akv murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat that has only a weak promoter-enhancer activity in the target cell, the lymphoid cell line L691. Under transient expression conditions, the strength of the Akv promoter-enhancer in the L691 cells is increased by dexamethasone. In cell clones with single vector integrations, a correlation is observed between the non-induced expression levels and the degree of dexamethasone induction. The strongest relative induction is found for the integrated vectors with the lowest non-induced expression levels and approaches the inducibility under transient expression. These results indicate that expression levels are composed of distinct contributions from the integrated vector and from the site of integration and are best explained in terms of a model in which the sites of chromosomal integration exert variable positive enhancer effects upon vector transcription.Images"
785,1993,A critical review of studies of the association between demands for hospital services and air pollution.,"Studies of the associations between air pollution and hospital admissions and emergency room use are reviewed, including studies of air pollution episodes, time-series analyses, and cross-sectional analyses. These studies encompass a variety of methods of analysis and levels of air quality. Findings from all three types of studies were generally consistent in that almost all of the studies reviewed found statistically significant associations between hospital use and air pollution; this unanimity may have resulted in part from publication bias. These associations were characterized by elasticities of the order of 0.20; i.e., a 100% change in air pollution was associated with a change in hospital use of about 20%, for specific diagnoses. Respiratory diagnoses were emphasized by most studies; cardiac diagnoses were included in five of them. The air pollutants most often associated with changes in hospital use were particulate matter, sulfur oxides, and oxidants. Apart from the major air pollution episodes, there was no obvious link between air pollution level and the significance or magnitudes of the associations. Long-term indicators of hospitalization appeared to also be influenced by medical care supply factors, including the numbers of beds and physicians per capita. These nonpathological causal factors could also have influenced the findings of the time-series studies by introducing extraneous factors in the patterns of admissions. Although consistent associations have been shown between hospital use and air pollution, further research is required to distinguish among potentially responsible pollutants and to deduce specific dose-response relationships of general utility."
786,1993,Activation and repression of Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase distal transcription by two steroid hormone receptor superfamily members binding to a common response element.,"Developmental activation of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) distal promoter is controlled by the Adh adult enhancer (AAE). Within this 150 bp, complex enhancer is a small (12 bp) positive cis-acting element that is required for high levels of distal transcription in adult flies and ADH-expressing tissue culture cells. We previously reported that the steroid receptor superfamily member FTZ-F1 binds to this site. We have identified a second steroid receptor superfamily member, DHR39, which also binds to this site. DHR39 is expressed throughout development in transcripts of several sizes. In situ hybridization to embryos has shown that DHR39 RNA is found primarily in the central nervous system, and not in embryonic tissues that express ADH. FTZ-F1 RNA, however, shows temporal-specific patterns similar to those of the distal promoter. FTZ-F1 and DHR39 have identical amino acids in the 'P-box' of the DNA binding domain, suggesting that they have identical DNA recognition characteristics. By electrophoretic mobility shift analysis we show that a DHR39 fusion protein binds specifically to two FTZ-F1 binding sites. By over expressing the full length DHR39 protein in a transient co-transfection assay we have shown that it represses distal Adh expression in a dosage- and binding site-dependent manner. Over expression of an alternative DHR39 open reading frame that lacks part of the putative ligand binding domain does not alter Adh expression. In contrast, over expression of FTZ-F1 specifically activates distal Adh expression.Images"
787,1993,Activation of a dual adenovirus promoter containing nonconsensus TATA motifs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe: role of TATA sequences in the efficiency of transcription.,"The role of TATA elements in the expression of a mammalian promoter was investigated in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, by studying the human adenovirus E2-early promoter. This is a unique dual promoter with two nonconsensus TATA elements directing transcription from two cap sites, +1 and -26. A sequence TTAAGA provides the TATA box function for the +1 promoter, whereas a sequence TAAATT, with a closer resemblance to the consensus (TATAA/TA) provides this function for the -26 promoter. Yet, in human cells, the +1 promoter is transcribed about 20 fold more efficiently than the -26 promoter. We found that both promoters are transcribed faithfully in S. pombe with start sites identical or close to those found in human cells. Surprisingly, the relative ratio of expression for the +1 and -26 promoters was exactly reversed in S. pombe cells. This reversal appeared to be due to the relatively weak binding of S. pombe TATA binding protein to the TTAAGA motif, rather than to its rate of dissociation. Furthermore, we show that in S. pombe, promoter expression correlates well with the nucleotide sequence of the TATA element rather than the context in which it is placed. By contrast, it is the context of the TATA element, rather than its nucleotide sequence that appears to be critical for promoter expression in human cells. Our data suggest the existence of one or more additional factors in human cells that permit the utilization of nonconsensus TATA elements. S. pombe appears to lack these factors.Images"
788,1993,Activation of HIV-specific ribozyme activity by self-cleavage.,"A hammerhead ribozyme designed to cleave in trans the R region of HIV-1 RNA was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector. This ribozyme was studied in vitro using the T3 RNA polymerase promoter located upstream of the eukaryotic promoter. The ribozyme showed no activity against its specific target sequence under any condition tested. To decrease the influence of potential cis inhibitory sequences in such a ribozyme transcript, a specific target sequence was inserted upstream of the ribozyme-coding sequence. This insertion allowed the release by cis cleavage of a short RNA bearing ribozyme activity and able to cleave in trans an external RNA target. The cis cleavage reaction generated two RNA molecules: the shorter RNA species, which included the catalytic domain, showed a trans cleavage reaction. This self-cleavable ribozyme was active in vitro at 37 degrees C against three distinct HIV-1 transcripts sharing the specific target sequence. Ribozyme activity was thus attained by self-cleavage of the ribozyme-containing sequence from the longer vector transcript.Images"
789,1993,Activation of the cryptic DNA binding function of mutant forms of p53.,"Wild type p53 assembles into a latent multiprotein complex which can be activated for sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro by proteins targeting the carboxy-terminal domain. Using an optimized system coupling the post-translational modification of wild type p53 to activation of sequence specific DNA binding, we examined the affects of common mutations on the cryptic DNA binding function of p53. Two mutant forms of p53 were shown to be efficiently converted from the latent state by PAb421 and DnaK, but were defective in activation by casein kinase II, indicating that mutant p53 may not be receptive to allosteric regulation by casein kinase II phosphorylation. A reactive sulfhydryl group is absolutely required for DNA binding by wild type and mutant forms of p53 once converted to the activated state. Together, these data show that some mutant forms of p53 harbour the wild-type machinery required to engage in sequence-specific DNA binding and define a signalling pathway whose inactivation may directly result in a loss of p53 function.Images"

Ribozymes with 17 and 19 atom linkers, in combination with a 4 base pair stem II, had catalytic efficiencies which were 2 fold increased to that of the parent ribozyme with a tetranucleotide loop. Ribozymes with these linkers, but in combination with a 2 base pair stem II, showed a 2 fold decrease in catalytic efficiency when compared to the parent ribozyme. Prolonged preincubation in the presence of MgCl2 was required for hexaethylene glycol linker-modified ribozymes to obtain maximum activity and reproducible kinetic data.Images"
792,1993,Activity of U-snRNA genes with modified placement of promoter elements in transfected protoplasts and stably transformed tobacco.,"In higher plants the promoter elements of pol II- and pol III-transcribed U-snRNA genes are identical, comprising a -30 TATA box and an upstream sequence element, USE. The USE and TATA are centred approximately four and three helical DNA turns apart in pol II and pol III genes, respectively, and it is this difference in the element spacing that determines the RNA polymerase specificity of the gene. In this study we have analyzed the effect of spacing mutations on activity of Arabidopsis U2 and U6 genes in transfected protoplasts of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and in stably transformed tobacco. In the pol III-transcribed U6 gene the insertions and deletions of either odd or even numbers of half helical turns completely inactivate transcription in transfected protoplasts, consistent with the high conservation of the element spacing found in all plant U-snRNA genes. Surprisingly, while insertions of 50 base pairs (bp) or more into the spacer of the pol II-specific U2 gene inactivate transcription, a deletion of 5 bp or insertions of as much as 20 bp decrease transcription by only 40 to 70%. This relaxed requirement for the conserved element spacing is only seen in transfected protoplasts since the same mutant U2 genes are not transcribed in stably transformed tobacco when transcription takes place from the chromosome. The results provide some clues about possible factor interactions at the promoters of plant U-snRNA genes and also offer an example of major differences in transcription between transiently and stably transformed cells.Images"
793,1993,Activity of yeast FLP recombinase in maize and rice protoplasts.,"We have demonstrated that a yeast FLP/FRT site-specific recombination system functions in maize and rice protoplasts. FLP recombinase activity was monitored by reactivation of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression from vectors containing the gusA gene inactivated by insertion of two FRTs (FLP recombination targets) and a 1.31 kb DNA fragment. The stimulation of GUS activity in protoplasts cotransformed with vectors containing FRT inactivated gusA gene and a chimeric FLP gene depended on both the expression of the FLP recombinase and the presence and structure of the FRT sites. The FLP enzyme could mediate inter- and intramolecular recombination in plant protoplasts. These results provide evidence that a yeast recombination system can function efficiently in plant cells, and that its performance can be manipulated by structural modification of the FRT sites.Images"
794,1993,Acute Fulminant Pancreatitis: Debridement or Formal Resection of the Pancreas,"During the ten year period from 1980 to 1989, 51 patients were treated at Oulu University Central Hospital for fulminant acute pancreatitis. Five were in a moribund state on admission and died shortly afterwards, 6 were treated conservatively and survived, and 40 were operated on, 17 by primary pancreatic resection and 23 by debridement of the peripancreatic area. Mortality rates were 53 per cent for the resection group and for the debridement group 22 per cent. Reoperations were performed in 24 per cent of patients in the pancreatic resection group and in 60 per cent of those in the debridement group. The high mortality rate associated with primary pancreatic resection has caused us to adopt a more conservative strategy, and surgical treatment is directed towards later complications of this severe disease."

796,1993,Acute toxicity of gasoline and some additives.,"The acute toxicity of gasoline; its components benzene, toluene, and xylene; and the additives ethanol, methanol, and methyl tertiary butyl ether are reviewed. All of these chemicals are only moderately to mildly toxic at acute doses. Because of their volatility, these compounds are not extensively absorbed dermally unless the exposed skin is occluded. Absorption through the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract is quite efficient. After ingestion, the principal danger for a number of these chemicals, particularly gasoline, is aspiration pneumonia, which occurs mainly in children. It is currently not clear whether aspiration pneumonia would still be a problem if gasoline were diluted with ethanol or methanol. During the normal use of gasoline or mixtures of gasoline and the other solvents as a fuel, exposures would be much lower than the doses that have resulted in poisoning. No acute toxic health effects would occur during the normal course of using automotive fuels."
797,1993,"A damage-recognition protein which binds to DNA containing interstrand cross-links is absent or defective in Fanconi anemia, complementation group A, cells.","A DNA binding protein with specificity for DNA containing interstrand cross-links induced by 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP) plus long wavelength ultraviolet (UVA) light has been identified in normal human chromatin. Protein binding to DNA was determined using a gel mobility shift assay and an oligonucleotide containing a hot spot for formation of psoralen interstrand cross-links. Specificity of the damage-recognition protein for cross-links was demonstrated both by a positive correlation between level of cross-link formation in DNA and extent of protein binding and by effective competition by treated but not undamaged DNA for the binding protein. Chromatin protein extracts from cells from individuals with the genetic disorder, Fanconi anemia, complementation group A (FA-A), which have decreased ability to repair damage produced by TMP plus UVA light, failed to show any protein binding to TMP plus UVA treated DNA. We have previously shown that these chromatin protein extracts contain a DNA endonuclease complex, pI 4.6, which specifically recognizes and incises DNA containing interstrand cross-links and which in FA-A cells is defective in its ability to incise this damaged DNA (Lambert et al. (1992) Mutation Res., 273, 57-71). Together, these findings suggest that the DNA binding protein identified is involved in recognition and repair of DNA interstrand cross-links.Images"

799,1993,Adducted proteins for identification of endogenous electrophiles.,"Chemically reactive compounds in tissues can be monitored through their products of reaction with biomacromolecules. For the purpose of in vivo dose monitoring, hemoglobin (Hb) has been preferred to DNA because of its well-defined life span and more facile chemical identification of adducts. Through the N-alkyl Edman method, adducts to the N-terminals (valines) of the globin chains are measured mass spectrometrically with high sensitivity. In studies of low molecular weight adducts from occupational exposures or tobacco smoke, background levels were found in nonexposed control persons. In some cases the origin of these adducts could be determined. For instance, the 2-hydroxyethyl adduct has been shown to originate from ethylene oxide, a metabolite of endogenously produced ethene. The measured level, about 20 pmole/g globin, agrees well with the ethylene oxide dose calculated from expired ethene. Animal studies indicate contributions from the intestinal flora and dietary factors. An average background level of about 200 pmole/g globin of methylvaline has been observed in unexposed humans. From reaction-kinetic studies of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), it has been shown that the background mainly originates from SAM. In twin studies, a genetic influence on the level has been shown. Furthermore, a contribution from tobacco smoking to the level was demonstrated in these studies. Certain aldehydes, e.g., malonaldehyde, have been shown to be related to dietary factors and lipid peroxidation. These studies show the usefulness of the method in a search for reactive compounds in the body, with the ultimate goal of assessing the total genotoxic load."
800,1993,A deletion mutant of the type IC restriction endonuclease EcoR1241 expressing a novel DNA specificity.,"We have developed a complementation assay which allows us to distinguish between mutations affecting subunit assembly and mutations affecting DNA binding in the DNA recognition subunit (HsdS) of the multimeric restriction endonuclease EcoR1241. A number of random point mutations were constructed to test the validity of this assay. Two of the mutants produced were found to be truncated polypeptides that were still capable of complementation with the EcoR1241 Hsd subunits to give an active restriction enzyme of novel DNA specificity. The N-terminal variable domain (responsible for recognition of GAA from the EcoR1241 recognition sequence GAAnnnnnnRTCG) and the spacer region (central conserved region) is intact in both of these mutants. One of these mutant genes (hsdS(delta 50) has been cloned as an active Mtase. Purification of the Mtase proved to be difficult because the complex is weak. However, Mtase activity was obtained from a soluble cell extract, and this allowed us to determine the DNA recognition sequence of the Mtase to be GAAnnnnnnnTTC. This recognition sequence is an inverted repeat of 5'-end of the EcoR1241 recognition sequence. This suggests that the mutant Mtase is assembled from two inverted HsdS(D50) subunits, possibly held together by the HsdM subunits.Images"

802,1994,"1,3-Butadiene: linking metabolism, dosimetry, and mutation induction.","There is increasing concern for the potential adverse health effects of human exposures to chemical mixtures. To better understand the complex interactions of chemicals within a mixture, it is essential to develop a research strategy which provides the basis for extrapolating data from single chemicals to their behavior within the chemical mixture. 1,3-Butadiene (BD) represents an interesting case study in which new data are emerging that are critical for understanding interspecies differences in carcinogenic/genotoxic response to BD. Knowledge regarding mechanisms of BD-induced carcinogenicity provides the basis for assessing the potential effects of mixtures containing BD. BD is a multisite carcinogen in B6C3F1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Mice exhibit high sensitivity relative to the rat to BD-induced tumorigenesis. Since it is likely that BD requires metabolic activation to mutagenic reactive epoxides that ultimately play a role in carcinogenicity of the chemical, a quantitative understanding of the balance of activation and inactivation is essential for improving our understanding and assessment of human risk following exposure to BD and chemical mixtures containing BD. Transgenic mice exposed to 625 ppm BD for 6 hr/day for 5 days exhibited significant mutagenicity in the lung, a target organ for the carcinogenic effect of BD in mice. In vitro studies designed to assess interspecies differences in the activation of BD and inactivation of BD epoxides reveal that significant differences exist among mice, rats, and humans. In general, the overall activation/detoxication ratio for BD metabolism was approximately 10-fold higher in mice compared to rats or humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Strongly fluorescent structures for selective introduction in defined sequence DNA and RNA molecules.","Synthesis of 1,N6-etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine, 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine, and further chemistry on both deoxy and ribo series etheno nucleosides produces the corresponding phosphoramidites. These novel phosphoramidites are introduced selectively, quantitatively, and at specific positions at single or multiple sites into DNA or RNA sequences. The purification and chemistry involved in the synthesis of these products has been optimized to achieve the purity in excess of 99%. The resulting phosphoramidites were tested for their ability to couple and produce poly deoxy and ribonucleotides by solid phase chemistry. The coupling efficiency achieved was greater than 99% per step. Due to the instability of these etheno compounds in acidic and basic medium, various criteria to obtain pure oligomers have been established. The selective introduction of these fluorescent nucleosides into defined sequence DNA and RNA molecule will greatly facilitate the structure-function studies of various RNAs, protein-RNA structures, and DNA-RNA based diagnostics applications. The characteristic and high fluorescent intensity (detection below 1 x 10(-9) M for adenosine sites and below 1 x 10(-7) M for cytidine sites) is particularly suited for the biochemical and biological research and product development applications. The usefulness of these etheno containing modified sequences as sequencing and amplification primers is demonstrated by their full participation in polymerase chain reaction experiments.Images"

807,1994,3' end processing of mouse histone pre-mRNA: evidence for additional base-pairing between U7 snRNA and pre-mRNA.,"We have analysed the extent of base-pairing interactions between spacer sequences of histone pre-mRNA and U7 snRNA present in the trans-acting U7 snRNP and their importance for histone RNA 3' end processing in vitro. For the efficiently processed mouse H4-12 gene, a computer analysis revealed that additional base pairs could be formed with U7 RNA outside of the previously recognised spacer element (stem II). One complementarity (stem III) is located more 3' and involves nucleotides from the very 5' end of U7 RNA. The other, more 5' located complementarity (stem I) involves nucleotides of the Sm binding site of U7 RNA, a part known to interact with snRNP structural proteins. These potential stem structures are separated from each other by short internal loops of unpaired nucleotides. Mutational analyses of the pre-mRNA indicate that stems II and III are equally important for interaction with the U7 snRNP and for processing, whereas mutations in stem I have moderate effects on processing efficiency, but do not impair complex formation with the U7 snRNP. Thus nucleotides near the processing site may be important for processing, but do not contribute to the assembly of an active complex by forming a stem I structure. The importance of stem III was confirmed by the ability of a complementary mutation in U7 RNA to suppress a stem III mutation in a complementation assay using Xenopus laevis oocytes. The main role of the factor(s) binding to the upstream hairpin loop is to stabilise the U7-pre-mRNA complex. This was shown by either stabilising (by mutation) or destabilising (by increased temperature) the U7-pre-mRNA base-pairing under conditions where hairpin factor binding was either allowed or prevented (by mutation or competition). The hairpin dependence of processing was found to be inversely related to the strength of the U7-pre-mRNA interaction.Images"
808,1994,5-Hydroxypyrimidine deoxynucleoside triphosphates are more efficiently incorporated into DNA by exonuclease-free Klenow fragment than 8-oxopurine deoxynucleoside triphosphates.,"Recent studies with 8-oxodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxodGTP) have suggested that incorporation of oxidized nucleotides from the precursor pool into DNA may have deleterious effects. Here we show that 5-hydroxydeoxycytosine triphosphate (5-OHdCTP) and 5-hydroxydeoxyuridine triphosphate (5-OHdUTP) are more efficient substrates than 8-oxodGTP for Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment lacking proofreading activity, while 8-oxodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (8-oxodGTP, 5-OHdCTP can mispair with dA in DNA but with lower efficiency. Since the 5-hydroxypyrimidines are present in normal and oxidized cellular DNA in amounts similar to the 8-oxopurines, these data suggest that enzymatic mechanisms might exist for removing them from the DNA precursor pools.Images"

811,1994,Ability of History Taking Alone to Identify Early Pregnancies Among Potential Measles Vaccinees,"Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the ability of history taking alone, compared with pregnancy testing, to identify early pregnancies among potential female measles vaccinees. Methods: As part of an institution-wide measles immunization program, 326 female health care workers (HCWs) who denied being pregnant underwent a urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination. Results: Of the 326 women, 3 had positive pregnancy tests and were ultimately confirmed to be pregnant. Although all 3 women denied the possibility of pregnancy prior to testing, 2 had been unable to give an exact date for their last menstrual period (LMP). Conclusions: In this group of 326 northern New England HCWs being immunized against measles during an outbreak, history taking alone failed to identify 3 pregnancies. If the inability to give an exact date of the LMP had been included as a discriminator, 2 additional pregnancies could have been suspected, but 1 pregnancy still would have gone undetected."
812,1994,A biomarker approach to assessing xenobiotic exposure in Atlantic tomcod from the North American Atlantic coast.,"We determined levels of hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA, hepatic DNA adducts, and fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs) in bile, a measure of exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, in Atlantic tomcod from six river systems ranging from highly polluted to relatively pristine on the northeast North American coast (the Hudson River, New York; the St. Lawrence River, Quebec; the Miramichi River, New Brunswick; the Saco and Royal rivers, Maine; and the Margaree River, Nova Scotia). Hudson River tomcod showed the greatest response for all parameters, and tomcod from the Margaree River exhibited the least response. Tomcod from the Miramichi River exhibited marked induction of CYP1A mRNA but low levels of hepatic DNA adducts and biliary FACs, whereas fish from the St. Lawrence River showed no induction of CYP1A mRNA and moderately elevated levels of DNA adducts and biliary FACs. In tomcod from the Hudson and Miramichi rivers, the levels of CYP1A mRNA were 28 times and 14 times, respectively, as great as the levels in fish from the St. Lawrence, Saco/Royal, and Margaree rivers. Mean levels of DNA adducts varied from 120 nmol adducts/mol bases in Hudson River tomcod to &lt; 3 nmol adducts/mol bases in fish from the Miramichi and Margaree rivers. Concentrations of FACs in the bile of tomcod from the Hudson and St. Lawrence rivers were 8 and 1.8 times, respectively, as great as the concentrations in tomcod from the Miramichi River and Margaree River. In tomcod from the Hudson River, all three biomarkers were markedly elevated; in the St. Lawrence River two biomarkers were elevated, in the Miramichi River one was elevated, but no biomarker was substantially elevated in fish from the Saco/Royal and Margaree rivers. Elevated levels of hepatic DNA adducts and biliary FACs in tomcod from the Hudson River suggest increased exposure to PAHs, consistent with previous studies.Imagesp764-aFigure 1.Figure 2. aFigure 2. bFigure 2. cFigure 3.Figure 4.Figure 5. aFigure 5. bFigure 5. cFigure 5. dFigure 5. eFigure 6.Figure 7. aFigure 7. bFigure 7. c"

816,1994,Abundance of nuclear DNA topoisomerase II is correlated with proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Topoisomerase II (TOPII) is an important enzyme involved in DNA replication and chromosome condensation. The level of TOPII expression has been correlated with the proliferative state of eukaryotic cells. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA clone AtTopII encoding the first reported TOPII from higher plants. AtTopII is 4603 base pairs (bp) in length and encodes an open reading frame of 1473 amino acid residues. One interesting feature of AtTopII is the presence of a 110 bp direct repeat in the last one-third of the cDNA. Analysis of the genomic sequence within this region by PCR revealed that this duplication includes a small intron of 89 bp. Conservation of sequences within this repeated intron suggests that this in-frame duplication may be a relatively recent event. The deduced amino acid sequence of AtTopII shows strong homologies to TOPII sequences reported from other eukaryotes, particularly in the regions that are highly conserved among different species. Southern blot analysis with Arabidopsis DNA indicates that AtTopII is a single-copy gene while Northern blots detected a 5.0 kb transcript, the level of which is substantially higher in young seedlings than in mature plants. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the C-terminal one-third of AtTOPII, we found that the protein is localized in the nucleus and its level is correlated with the proliferative state of the particular tissue.Images"
817,1994,A carbamate insecticide: a case study of aldicarb.,"Aldicarb, the active ingredient in the insecticide TEMIK, was introduced to the agricultural community over 25 years ago. It has been registered worldwide to control a wide variety of insect, mite, and nematode pests in agriculture. The toxicological research database supporting the registration and use of aldicarb was generated over more than 25 years and contains more than 280 animal studies on 12 species of animals, 2 clinical human trials, and over 20 human monitoring studies. This database, which includes biochemical aspects (metabolism and mode-of-action studies), acute toxicity and special short-term toxicity studies, long-term toxicity studies, and epidemiological observations in humans, serves as the starting point for the evaluation of the risks associated with the acceptance of levels of aldicarb residues in food and drinking water and for the more direct occupational exposure. This article highlights the available toxicological data and reviews worldwide regulation of aldicarb. Included in these discussions is a brief description of the toxicological end point upon which regulatory decisions have been based, namely acetylcholinesterase depression. Aldicarb, the N-methylcarbamic acid ester of 2-methyl-2-(methylthio) propionaldehyde oxime, was the first of a limited group of insecticidal oxime N-methylcarbamates that have properties distinct from N-methylcarbamates which have a phenolic constituent, instead of the oxime moiety. Aldicarb is highly water-soluble (approximately 6000 ppm), nonvolatile, relatively stable under acidic conditions, and is easily degraded under alkaline conditions. These properties are important determinants of its systemic action in plants and of its problematic environmental behavior. Possible environmental hazards involving the chemical include groundwater contamination and (more recently) excessive terminal residues in certain foods."

819,1994,A cellular repressor regulates transcription initiation from the minute virus of mice P38 promoter.,"We previously reported that the P38 promoter of minute virus of mice (MVM) is trans activated by the viral nonstructural protein, NS1, through an interaction with a downstream promoter element designated DPE. In this communication we report the identification of a distinct downstream promoter element which inhibits transcription from the P38 promoter in vitro, in the absence of the DPE. Removal of 34 bp from the region between +95 and +129 downstream from the P38 initiation start site relieved inhibition of transcription in whole-cell extract. Inhibition was also relieved by the addition, to the transcription reaction, of excess DNA fragments which span the putative inhibiting element. This indicated the involvement of a trans-acting factor, in inhibition of transcription from the P38. Gel retardation experiments demonstrated the specific binding of a cellular protein to the inhibitory element. This P38 inhibitory element shows spacing and orientation dependence as well as promoter specificity. The regulation of viral transcription by a cellular repressor may play an important role in obtaining a fine temporal order of viral gene expression during the course of infection.Images"
820,1994,A chimeric Rec-A protein that implicates non-Watson-Crick interactions in homologous pairing.,"The helical filament formed by RecA protein on single-stranded DNA plays an important role in homologous recombination and pairs with a complementary single strand or homologous duplex DNA. The RecA nucleoprotein filament also recognizes an identical single strand. The chimeric protein, RecAc38, forms a nucleoprotein filament that recognizes a complementary strand but is defective in recognition of duplex DNA, and is associated with phenotypic defects in repair and recombination. As described here, RecAc38 nucleoprotein filament is also defective in recognition of an identical strand, either when the filament has within it a single strand or duplex DNA. A model that postulates three DNA binding sites rationalizes these observations and suggests that the third binding site mediates non-Watson-Crick interactions that are instrumental in recognition of homology in duplex DNA.Images"
821,1994,A cluster of constitutive mutations affecting the C-terminus of the redox-sensitive SoxR transcriptional activator.,"Activation of Escherichia coli oxidative stress regulon genes (sodA, zwf, fumC, nfo, etc.) is mediated by a two-stage regulatory system: the redox-sensitive SoxR protein transcriptionally activates the soxS gene, whose product then stimulates transcription of the regulon genes. Previous experiments showed that limited 3' truncation of soxR gene causes constitutive soxRS expression. DNA sequence analysis of the soxR genes from the soxRS-constitutive strains isolated originally (Greenberg et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 6181-6185) revealed that three alleles encode amino acid substitutions or a chain termination clustered near the C-terminus of SoxR. Two other single-amino-acid substitutions in constitutive alleles mapped to the helix-turn-helix motif and to a region of unknown function in the center of the polypeptide, respectively. No constitutive mutation was found within the region encoding the cysteines of the SoxR FeS center, in the soxR or soxS promoters, or in the soxS structural gene. Since an in-frame deletion of just nine SoxR residues (136-144; full-length SoxR = 154 residues) gave rise to a powerful constitutive allele, it appears that a small segment of the SoxR C-terminus maintains the protein in the inactive state. Conservely, an intact C-terminus is evidently not required for gene activation by SoxR."
822,1994,A common core structure for U3 small nucleolar RNAs.,"U3 nucleolar small RNA (snRNA) is involved in early processing of the primary rRNA transcript. A secondary structure model for the unusually small Trypanosoma brucei U3 snRNA was deduced by chemical modification and enzymatic cleavage of U3 snRNA in deproteinized and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) forms. Comprehensive alignment of U3 snRNAs from vertebrate, plant, fungal and protozoan species clearly delineated conserved and divergent features. The 5' domain of the T. brucei U3 snRNA appears to form one small, flexible 5' stem loop structure followed by a long single-stranded region; this model is a variation on 5' domain structures proposed for other U3 snRNAs which do not conform to a single model. The 3' domain of T. brucei U3 snRNA contains four single-stranded sequences conserved between U3 snRNAs. Of these, structural probing determined that the configurations of GAU region and box B and C sequences are altered by protein interactions in U3 snRNP. Conspicuously, the 3' domains of trypanosomal U3 snRNAs lack stem loops II and III, indicating that these structures are not required for conserved U3 snRNA functions.Images"
823,1994,A comparative database of group I intron structures.,"We have created a database of comparatively derived group I intron secondary structure diagrams. This collection currently contains a broad sampling of phylogenetically and structurally similar and diverse structures from over 200 publicly available intron sequences. As more group I introns are sequenced and added to the database, we anticipate minor refinements in these secondary structure diagrams. These diagrams are directly accessible by computer as well as from the authors."
824,1994,A comparison of continuous- and discrete- time three-state models for rodent tumorigenicity experiments.,"The three-state illness-death model provides a useful way to characterize data from a rodent tumorigenicity experiment. Most parametrizations proposed recently in the literature assume discrete time for the death process and either discrete or continuous time for the tumor onset process. We compare these approaches with a third alternative that uses a piecewise continuous model on the hazards for tumor onset and death. All three models assume proportional hazards to characterize tumor lethality and the effect of dose on tumor onset and death rate. All of the models can easily be fitted using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The piecewise continuous model is particularly appealing in this context because the complete data likelihood corresponds to a standard piecewise exponential model with tumor presence as a time-varying covariate. It can be shown analytically that differences between the parameter estimates given by each model are explained by varying assumptions about when tumor onsets, deaths, and sacrifices occur within intervals. The mixed-time model is seen to be an extension of the grouped data proportional hazards model [Mutat. Res. 24:267-278 (1981)]. We argue that the continuous-time model is preferable to the discrete- and mixed-time models because it gives reasonable estimates with relatively few intervals while still making full use of the available information. Data from the ED01 experiment illustrate the results."
825,1994,A comparison of the Antileukaemic Effects of Recombinant Human Tumour Necrosis Factor-ë± and its Muteins on Leukaemia L1210 and Leukaemia P388 in Mice,"We investigated the influence of recombinant human tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-ë±) and its derivatives termed muteins III, V, VI‰ÛÓin which the first 3 to 7 amino acids of native TNF-ë± have been replaced‰ÛÓon the survival time of mice inoculated with leukaemia L1210 or leukaemia P338. TNF-ë± prolonged the survival of mice with leukaemia L1210 but did not have any therapeutic activity in leukaemia P388-bearing mice. Muteins-treated mice with leukaemia P388 lived longer than animals receiving TNF-ë±, while those inoculated with leukaemia L1210 did not show any significant prolongation of life compared with the TNF-ë± treated group. The results presented in this report indicate that the antileukaemic activity of TNF-ë± is governed at least in part by the nature of the N-terminal amino acids."
826,1994,A COMPARISON OF THE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS OF VICTORIAN CHIROPRACTIC AND OSTEOPATHIC CLINICS,"While there are studies that describe the patient demographics of both Australian and American chiropractic clinics, such information appears difficult to find for physiotherapy or osteopathic clinics comparative data of any kind doesn't appear to exist. This study attempted to provide this data for Australian practices and to analyse any similarities or differences between populations.Results obtained for chiropractors and osteopaths would appear to suggest that there may be significant differences between the diagnostic profiles of the two professions. Physiotherapists withdrew from the - process during data collection.Suggestions are made relating to possible modifications I to the survey instrument and possible directions any future study might take."

830,1994,Activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase alters the chromatin structure of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator gene promoter.,"In LLC-PK1 cells, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene is induced by two of the major signal transduction pathways, the protein kinase C (PKC) and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathways. We have analyzed the chromatin structure of 26 kb of the uPA gene locus and have shown that PKA activation but not PKC activation induce major chromatin structural alterations in the uPA gene promoter. In uninduced cells, several DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites were detected in the 5' and 3' flanking regions but not in the transcribed region. Two of the sites correspond to previously characterized regulatory sites: a cAMP responsive site at nucleotide position -3500 with respect to the initiation site, and the PEA3/AP1 site at -2100 that mediates PKC activation. After the activation of PKA but not PKC, a strong HS site was induced at -2600. Functional analysis of this region revealed cAMP responsive activity. Chromatin structural alterations again brought about specifically by PKA but not by PKC were were also detected in the upstream of the promoter by topoisomerase I cleavage site analysis, with two prominent sites appearing at -2800 and -3300. These results suggest that the strong cAMP induction of the uPA gene requires structural alterations that permit cooperative interactions between the multiple cAMP responsive sites.Images"
831,1994,Activation of c-Jun transcription factor by substitution of a charged residue in its N-terminal domain.,"C-Jun is a cellular transcription factor that can control gene expression in response to treatment of cells with phorbol esters, growth factors, and expression of some oncogenes. The ability of c-Jun to catalyze the transcription of certain genes is controlled, in part, by changes in the phosphorylation state of specific amino acids in c-Jun. One of the major sites that is phosphorylated during signal response is Ser73. Here we show that substitution of a negatively charged aspartic acid residue at 73 constitutively increased transcriptional activity of c-Jun. The Asp73 substitution also enhanced its availability to bind to DNA in a whole cell extract without altering its intrinsic DNA binding activity since the intrinsic activity was unaltered for the c-Jun mutant proteins expressed in a bacterial system. The negatively charged Asp substitution may mimic the negative charge of a phosphorylated serine at 73. The substitution of an uncharged alanine at 73 resulted in lowered activities. The N-terminal end of c-Jun containing these substitutions was fused to the DNA-binding region of the bovine papilloma virus E2 protein, and was able to confer the same activation properties to the fusion protein at the heterologous E2 DNA-binding site. Ser73 lies in a region of c-Jun previously proposed to bind an uncharacterized inhibitor, perhaps related to a protein of approximately 17.5 kD that coprecipitates along with our c-Jun or the JunE2 fusion products.Images"
832,1994,"Activation of myoD gene transcription by 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine: a direct role for the thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptors.","Thyroid hormones are major determinants of skeletal muscle differentiation in vivo. Triiodo-L-thyronine treatment promotes terminal muscle differentiation and results in increased MyoD gene transcription in myogenic cell lines; furthermore myoD and fast myosin heavy chain gene expression are activated in rodent slow twitch muscle fibers (Molecular Endocrinology 6: 1185-1194, 1992; Development 118: 1137-1147, 1993). We have identified a T3 response element (TRE) in the mouse MyoD promoter between nucleotide positions -337 and -309 (5' CTGAGGTCAGTACAGGCTGGAGGAGTAGA 3'). This sequence conferred an appropriate T3 response to an enhancerless SV40 promoter. In vitro binding studies showed that the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR alpha) formed a heterodimeric complex, with either the retinoid X receptor alpha or gamma 1 isoforms (RXR alpha, RXR gamm), on the MyoD TRE that was specifically competed by other well characterised TREs and not by other response elements. Analyses of this heterodimer with a battery of steroid hormone response elements indicated that the complex was efficiently competed by a direct repeat of the AGGTCA motif separated by 4 nucleotides as predicted by the 3-4-5 rule. EMSA experiments demonstrated that the nuclear factor(s) present in muscle cells that bound to the myoD TRE were constitutively expressed during myogenesis; this complex was competed by the myosin heavy chain, DR-4 and PAL-0 TREs in a sequence specific fashion. Western blot analysis indicated that TR alpha 1 was constitutively expressed during C2C12 differentiation. Mutagenesis of the myoD TRE indicated that the sequence of the direct repeats (AGGTCA) and the 4 nucleotide gap were necessary for efficient binding to the TR alpha/RXR alpha heterodimeric complex. In conclusion our data suggest that the TRE in the helix loop helix gene, myoD, is a target for the direct heterodimeric binding of TR alpha and RXR alpha/gamma. These results provide a molecular mechanism/model for the effects of triiodo-L-thyronine on in vitro myogenesis; the activation of myoD gene expression in the slow twitch fibres and the cascade of myogenic events regulated by thyroid hormone.Images"
833,1994,Activation of RuvC Holliday junction resolvase in vitro.,"The Escherichia coli RuvC protein is an endonuclease that resolves Holliday junctions. In vitro, the protein shows efficient structure-specific binding of Holliday junctions, yet the rate of junction resolution is remarkably low. We have mapped the sites of cleavage on a synthetic junction through which a crossover can branch migrate through 26 bp and find that &gt; or = 90% of the junctions were cleaved at one site. This observation of sequence-specific cleavage suggests that inefficient resolution may be due to DNA binding events which occur away from the cleavage site and are therefore non-productive. Holliday junction resolution by RuvC protein can be stimulated by a number of factors including: (i) the presence of Mn2+ (rather than Mg2+) as the divalent metal cofactor, (ii) alkaline pH (&lt; or = 10), and (iii) elevated temperature. These observations may indicate that other proteins are required for efficient RuvC-mediated resolution.Images"
834,1994,Activation of serum response element-regulated genes by lysophosphatidic acid.,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an important constituent of serum and shares its mitogenic activity. Serum induction of several genes is regulated, at least in part, by sequences related to the c-fos serum response element (SRE). A Rat-2 fibroblast cell line containing the beta-galactosidase reporter gene under SRE control was treated with LPA. Lysophosphatidic acid induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in beta-galactosidase activity. After 5 hours of treatment with 1-oleoyl-LPA a 3-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity was observed. In contrast, endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity did not change in parallel with the beta-galactosidase activity indicating that the induction was specific. Various LPAs with different acyl groups in the sn-1 position induced beta-galactosidase activity with a rank order potency of 1-oleoyl-LPA &gt; 1-palmitoyl-LPA &gt; or = 1-myristoyl-LPA &gt; 1-stearoyl-LPA. Phosphatidic acid was approximately equal to 1-stearoyl-LPA. Neither the calcium ionophore (A23187) nor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, induced beta-galactosidase activity. These data suggest that LPA may exert some of its effects by regulation of SRE controlled genes."
835,1994,Activation of the immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer in pre-B cells correlates with the suppression of a nuclear factor binding to a sequence flanking the active core.,"Both the kappa intron and the kappa 3' enhancer are required for high levels of immunoglobulin kappa gene expression. The activity of both enhancer elements can be induced by LPS in pre-B cells. While the LPS induction of the kappa intron enhancer is mediated by NF-kappa B, this factor is not responsible for activation of the 3' enhancer. Dissection of the 3' enhancer has shown that in pre-B cells the activity of the kappa 3' enhancer is repressed by a region flanking an active core element. We have now scanned this flanking region for nuclear factor binding sites and have identified sites for B-cell specific E47/E12-like proteins and two ubiquitous nuclear proteins. Furthermore, we have identified a nuclear factor in pre-B cells whose binding activity is suppressed in response to LPS. In its tissue-distribution and binding specificity this factor appears to be identical to the lymphoid specific protein LEF-1. The position of the LEF-1 binding site within the 3' enhancer and its response to LPS raise the possibility that LEF-1 may be the target for a second pathway able to mediate LPS induction of immunoglobulin kappa gene transcription.Images"
836,1994,Activation of the respiratory burst oxidase.,"The respiratory burst oxidase of phagocytes and B lymphocytes catalyzes the reduction of oxygen by NADPH to form O2-, the precursor of a group of reactive oxidants that are employed by phagocytes as microbicidal agents. The enzyme is active in stimulated cells but dominant in resting cells. It molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The components p22phox and gp91phox from cytochrome b558, a flavohemoprotein that resides in the cortical cytoskeleton and in the membranes of the specific granules. The other components are found in the cytosol of resting cells, but migrate to the cortical cytoskeleton when the neutrophils are activated, where they assemble the active oxidase. Migration to the cortical cytoskeleton is caused in part by the appearance of a membrane binding site on one or more of the cytosolic subunits, possibly due to the phosphorylation of p47phox that takes place during cell activation."
837,1994,Active oxygen species in DNA damage induced by carcinogenic metal compounds.,"Some carcinogenic metal compounds [chromate(VI), Fe(III) nitrilotriacetate, cobalt(II), and nickel(II)[ induced formation of various oxygen radical species in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. These oxygen radicals were suggested to give different kinds of site-specific DNA damage; 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine formation is included in the DNA damage. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, nickel sulfide was shown to induce oxidative DNA cleavage in cultured cells. On the basis of these findings, we have emphasized the role of oxygen radicals in metal carcinogenesis.ImagesFigure 4."
838,1994,Activity of the rat liver-specific aldolase B promoter is restrained by HNF3.,"Although it contains binding sites for HNF1, NFY and C/EBP/DBP, the proximal promoter of the aldolase B gene is surprisingly weak when tested by transient transfection in differentiated hepatoma cells. This low activity could be due to overlapping between HNF1 and HNF3 binding sites in element PAB, from -127 to -103 bp with respect to the cap site. Replacement of the PAB region by a consensus HNF1 binding site unable to bind HNF3, results in a 30 fold activation of the promoter, in accordance with the hypothesis that activity of the wild-type promoter is normally restrained by HNF3 binding to PAB competitively with HNF1. Consistently, transactivation of the wild-type promoter by excess HNF1 is very high, most likely due to the displacement of HNF3, while the construct with the exclusive HNF1 binding site is weakly transactivated by HNF1. The inhibitory effect of HNF3 on HNF1-dependent transactivation is clearly due to competition between these two factors for binding to mutually exclusive, overlapping sites; indeed, when HNF1 and HNF3 sites are contiguous and not overlapping, the resulting promoter is as active as the one containing an exclusive HNF1 binding site. A construct in which PAB has been replaced by an exclusive HNF3 binding site is weakly expressed and is insensitive to HNF3 hyperexpression. DBP-dependent transactivation, finally, is independent of the nature of the element present in the PAB region."
839,1994,Acute and chronic respiratory effects of sodium borate particulate exposures.,"This study examined work-related chronic abnormality in pulmonary function and work-related acute irritant symptoms associated with exposure to borate dust in mining and processing operations. Chronic effects were examined by pulmonary function at the beginning and end of a 7-year interval. Time-specific estimates of sodium borate particulate exposures were used to estimate cumulative exposure during the study interval. Change in pulmonary function over the 7 years was found unrelated to the estimate of cumulative exposure during that interval. Exposure-response associations also were examined with respect to short-term peak exposures and incidence of five symptoms of acute respiratory irritation. Hourly measures of health outcome and continuous measures of particulate exposure were made on each subject throughout the day. Whenever a subject reported one of the irritant symptoms, a symptom intensity score was also recorded along with the approximate time of onset. The findings indicated that exposure-response relationships were present for each of the specific symptoms at several symptom intensity levels. The associations were present when exposure was estimated by both day-long and short-term (15-min) time-weighted average exposures. Associations persisted after taking account of smoking, age, and the presence of a common cold. No significant difference in response rate was found between workers exposed to different types of sodium borate dusts."
840,1994,Acute appendicitis in young children in the Belfast urban area: 1985-1992.,"Eighty-one cases of acute appendicitis in children aged less than six years were identified in the Belfast urban area between 1985 and 1992. Appendiceal perforation, found in 43%, was related to symptom duration but not to age at presentation. Prolongation of symptoms was related to parental delay in seeking medical advice (52% &gt; 36 hours), delayed or inappropriate general practitioner referral to hospital (19%) and diagnostic delay following surgical consultation (12% &gt; 12 hours). Diagnostic delay in hospital was usually the result of nonspecificity of symptoms and signs and was therefore largely unavoidable. Delayed referral from general practice did not contribute unnecessarily to appendiceal perforation, and given that an individual general practitioner will see a case of preschool appendicitis once in 30 years, diagnostic accuracy was remarkably high."
841,1994,Acute Obstructive Hydrocephalus Due to Cysticercosis During Pregnancy,"Background: Cysticercosis, due to the parasite Taenia solium, can involve any organ. When central nervous system infection occurs, signs and symptoms depend on the location of the cerebral lesions. Most patients develop seizures, focal symptoms, or headaches with nausea and vomiting. Case: A case of extraparenchymal (intraventricular) cysticercosis was diagnosed in a patient at term who presented with acute alteration in mental status. Ventriculostomy was performed because of acute obstructive hydrocephalus. Labor ensued and was augmented with oxytocin. Intrapartum management included magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis and corticosteroids. Intracranial pressures ranged between 4 and 12 cm H2O peripartum with approximately 300 mL of cerebrospinal fluid drained over the first 24 hours. Postpartum management included craniotomy with resection of a larval cyst and oral praziquantel therapy. Conclusion: This case describes an uncommon presentation of neurocysticercosis that should be considered in gravidas with acute mental status changes."
842,1994,Acute Phase Protein Response and Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte Cathepsin G Release After Slow Interleukin-1 Stimulation in the Rat,"In this work we have studied the acute phase protein response and degranulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vivo in the rat after a slow interleukin-1ë_ stimulation. A total dose of 1 ë_g, 2 ë_g, 4 ë_g and 0 ë_g (controls with only vehicle) of interleukin-1ë_ was released from osmotic minipumps over a period of 7 days. The pumps were implanted subcutaneously. A cystic formation was formed around the pumps that contained interleukin-1ë_ whereas no tissue reaction was seen around pumps containing only vehicle. Besides flbroblasts the cyst wall contained numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes which were positively stained for cathespin G. ë±2-macroglobulin, ë±1-inhtbitor-3, ë±1-proteinase inhibitor, albumin and C3 were measured by electroimmunoassay and all showed plasma concentration patterns that were dose-dependent to the amount of interleuktn-1ë_ released. Fibrinogen in plasma was elevated in the control group but showed decreased plasma values with higher doses of interleukin-1ë_ released. All animals showed increased plasma levels of cathespin G but the lowest levels for cathespin G were seen for the highest interleukin-1ë_ dose released. It was clearly seen that a slow continuous release of interleukin-1ë_ in vivo caused an inflammatory reaction. Plasma levels for the proteins analysed all showed a similar pattern, namely an initial increase or decrease of plasma concentration followed by a tendency to normalization of plasma values. It was concluded that a long-term interleukin-1ë_ release could not sustain the acute phase protein response elicited by the initial interleukin-1ë_ release."
843,1994,Acute Phase Response in Patients With Uncomplicated and Complicated Endoscopic Retrogradic Cholangiopancreaticography,"Acute phase response after endoscopic retrogradic cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) was studied in 42 patients with suspected pancreatic or biliary diseases. In uncomplicated cases acute phase response determined by serum C-reactive protein levels was rare and did not parallel the serum amylase or lipase levels. In three of the these 42 patients, post-ERCP pancreatitis developed and CRP levels elevated sharply and paralleled the degree of pancreatitis. Six additional patients outside of this prospective study with post-ERCP-pancreatitis and daily CRP determinations were used to determine the CRP-response curve in post-ERCP pancreatitis."
844,1994,Acute silica toxicity: attenuation by amiodarone-induced pulmonary phospholipidosis.,"Exposure to the toxic mineral dust silica has been shown to produce an acute inflammatory response in the lungs of both humans and laboratory animals. Coating silica with phospholipids reduces its toxicity when studied with in vitro systems. The drug amiodarone increases phospholipid within the cells, airways, and alveoli of the lungs. This increase in phospholipid is due to amiodarone's ability to inhibit phospholipase activity within alveolar macrophages (AMs) and whole lung. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the amiodarone-induced increase in pulmonary phospholipid would protect the lungs from acute damage caused by the intratracheal instillation of silica. Treatment of male Fischer 344 rats with amiodarone for 14 days caused an increase in phospholipid content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and AMs compared to vehicle-treated controls. The rats were then instilled with silica or saline vehicle. At both 1 and 14 days after silica exposure, pulmonary phospholipidosis was associated with a marked reduction in acute silica-induced pulmonary damage as assessed by biochemical parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, however, the influx of neutrophils into the airspaces was not reduced. Four times more phospholipid was bound to the silica recovered from amiodarone-treated rats compared to controls. The results of these in vivo experiments indicate that pulmonary phospholipidosis attenuates the acute damage associated with the intratracheal instillation of silica in rats. By using an in vitro cell culture system, we demonstrated that, in contrast to control AMs, phospholipidotic AMs were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxicity of surfactant-coated silica.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)Imagesp372-aFigure 1.Figure 2.Figure 3.Figure 4.Figure 5.Figure 6.Figure 7.Figure 8."

846,1994,Adaptation to metals in widespread and endemic plants.,"Bryophytes, including the mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, occur in a variety of habitats with high concentrations of metals and have other characteristics that are advantageous for studies of metal tolerance. Mosses may evolve genetically specialized, metal-tolerant races less frequently than flowering plants. Some species of mosses appear to have inherently high levels of metal tolerance even in individuals that have not been subjected to natural selection in contaminated environments. Scopelophila cataractae, one of the so-called copper mosses, not only tolerates extremely high concentrations of metals in its substrates, but requires these substrates for optimum growth. This species should be included in mechanistic studies of tolerance at the cellular and molecular levels."
847,1994,Adaptive response and oxidative stress.,"The ability of a cell, tissue, or organism to better resist stress damage by prior exposure to a lesser amount of stress is known as adaptive response. It is observed in all organisms in response to a number of different cytotoxic agents. One of these agents, oxidative stress, is known to induce an adaptive response in bacteria that is accompanied by the induction of many proteins. De novo protein synthesis is required for adaptive response to oxidative and other types of stress, indicating that newly synthesized protective proteins are necessary for adaptation. Adaptive response to oxidative stress also has been observed in mammalian cells. Several studies suggest it is necessary to first preexpose mammalian cells to a somewhat toxic oxidative stress in order to observe significant resistance to a subsequent highly lethal dose of oxidant. Cross-resistance of oxidatively stressed cells to other toxic agents including gamma- and X-irradiation, heat shock, aldehydes, heavy metals, MNNG, N-ethylmaleimide, and heme also has been reported. Understanding oxidant adaptive response in more detail and identifying the protective proteins involved may prove to be of clinical benefit."
848,1994,Additional pathways of S-conjugate formation during the interaction of thiols with nitrosoarenes bearing pi-donating substituents.,"During the well-established reaction pathways of nitrosoarenes interacting with thiols, a reactive N-(thiol-S-yl)-arylamine cation was implicated in the so-called rearrangement reaction which transforms the semimercaptal to the sulfinamide. In the case of nitrosoarenes with pi-donating substituents, this cationic transition state includes resonance structures bearing the positive charge in 2 and 4 position, thereby facilitating the attack of nucleophiles to the aromatic ring. Investigating the reaction products of 4-nitrosophenetol and reduced glutathione in chemical systems and human red cells, some glutatione S-conjugates were detected other than the already known sulfenamide and sulfinamide. Three of them were separated by HPLC and identified by mass spectroscopy, 1H-NMR, and UV-visible spectroscopy, by determination of pKa values and chemical behavior. The hitherto unknown conjugates are 4-ethoxy-2-(glutathione-S-yl)-aniline, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-N'-(glutathione-S-yl)-benzoquinonediimine, and 4-amino-4'-ethoxy-2-(glutathione-S-yl)-diphenylamine. In preliminary experiments, some of these conjugates were shown to be highly active in producing ferrihemoglobin. Considerations on the formation pathways of these metabolites lend further support to the electrophilic N-(glutathione-S-yl)arylamine cation as a reactive intermediate that may be implicated in nitrosoarene toxicity."

850,1994,Adenovirus 12-mediated down-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I promoter: identification of a negative regulatory element responsive to Ad12 E1A.,"In highly oncogenic adenovirus (Ad) 12-transformed cells, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression is down-regulated by the products of the viral E1A oncogene at the level of initiation of transcription. However, class I gene expression is unaltered or elevated in non-oncogenic Ad2- or Ad5-transformed cells. These changes in class I expression may permit Ad12-transformed cells to escape host immune surveillance and elicit tumour formation. Here we show that the 2kb of 5' flanking region of the mouse H-2Kb class I gene is sufficient to mediate down-regulation of transcription driven from homologous or heterologous (HSV thymidine kinase) basal promoter elements in cells expressing Ad12 E1A, but not in Ad2 E1A-expressing cells. Deletion analysis of the 2kb region showed that sequences from -1.18 to -1.44kb (relative to the cap site) were a target for Ad12 E1A-mediated transcriptional down-regulation. Deletion of this entire region from the 2kb flanking sequence of the H-2Kb gene abolished Ad12 E1A-mediated down-regulation of transcription. Computer analysis of the -1.18 to -1.44kb sequence identified two 6/7bp matches with the AP-1 transcription factor consensus sequence and two matches with the pig MHC class I PD1 repressor element. Gel retardation analysis using overlapping DNA fragments derived from the -1.18 to -1.44kb sequence revealed several DNA:protein complexes formed using nuclear extract derived from Ad12-, but not from Ad2- or Ad5-transformed cells. Some of these DNA:protein complexes were also present, but at lower levels, in nuclear extracts from untransformed rat cells suggesting the possible involvement of cellular factors in the mechanism of down-regulation mediated by Ad12 E1A. A binding site for the AP-1 factor failed to compete for protein binding to fragments within the -1.18 to -1.44 sequence, while the PD1 site competed for binding only in the -1.15 to -1.23 region. These results indicate that novel factors (as well as a previously identified class I repressor, PD1) may be involved in Ad12 E1A-mediated down-regulation of MHC class I transcription.Images"

852,1995,3-D models of the antigenomic ribozyme of the hepatitis delta agent with eight new contacts suggested by sequence analysis of 188 cDNA clones.,"We mapped 359 mutations at 25 positions in synthetic variants of the antigenomic ribozyme of the hepatitis delta agent by analyzing the sequences of 188 cDNA clones. These data were used to identify three features of the ribozyme: highly conserved nucleotides, positions with restricted nucleotide substitutions and three-dimensional relationships between nucleotides. The distribution of mutations at the 25 positions was as follows: G-11 (the eleventh nucleotide from the cleavage site) was mutated in 56 clones; G-12 in 36; U-15 in 33; C-13 in 26; G-28 in 23; C-27 in 21; C-29 in 19; U-26 in 17; C-18 in 14; A-14 in 13; C-16 in 13; C-19 in 12; U-17 in 11; A-20 in 10; G-42 in 9; G-40 in 7; G-41 in 7; C-24 in 6; U-32 in 6; U-23 in 5; C-25 in 4; C-21 in 3; G-30 in 3; G-31 in 3; C-22 in 1. All clones containing a mutation at C-25 had an A at this position, suggesting that the extra cyclic amino group present in adenine and cytosine may function during the cleavage event. Mutations at certain positions were common in simple clones (containing only one or two mutations), while mutations at other positions were over-represented in more complex clones. Both compensatory base changes and co-mutational frequencies were used to identify eight pairs of nucleotides which may interact with each other: G-11 and C-18, G-12 and C-27, C-13 and G-28, C-21 and U-23/C-24, C-21 and G-30, U-23 and G-31/U-32, C24 and G-30, C-27 and G-42. These pairs, which involve some of the most conserved positions in the molecule, suggest interactions among nucleotides previously depicted in open-loop structures. The newly proposed points of contact between pairs of nucleotides are compatible with both the axehead and pseudoknot secondary structural models and were combined with previously proposed Watson-Crick base paired helices to produce two three dimensional models. In both of these, C-25 and C-76 are placed near the cleavage site."
853,1995,3-Nitropyrrole and 5-nitroindole as universal bases in primers for DNA sequencing and PCR.,"3-Nitropyrrole and 5-nitroindole have been assessed as universal bases in primers for dideoxy DNA sequencing and in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In contrast to a previous report, we have found that the introduction of more than one 3-nitropyrrole residue at dispersed positions into primers significantly reduced their efficiency in PCR and sequencing reactions. Primers containing 5-nitroindole at multiple dispersed positions were similarly affected; for both bases only a small number of substitutions were tolerated. In PCR experiments neither base, when incorporated into primers in codon third positions, was as effective as hypoxanthine, which was incorporated in six codon third positions in a 20mer oligomer. However, primers containing up to four consecutive 5-nitroindole substitutions performed well in both PCR and sequencing reactions. Consecutive 3-nitropyrrole substitutions were tolerated, but less well in comparable reactions.Images"

855,1995,5'-Cholesteryl-phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides: potent inhibition of methotrexate transport and antagonism of methotrexate toxicity in cells containing the reduced-folate carrier.,"Polyanionic 5'-cholesteryl-phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides of varying polymer length and nucleobase composition were examined for an effect on methotrexate transport via the reduced-folate carrier of L1210 mouse cells. Methotrexate transport was inhibited by each of the oligodeoxynucleotide analogs tested. Inhibition was most pronounced (IC50 = 0.21 microM, standard assay) for a 5'-cholesteryl heteropolymer consisting of 15 phosphorothioate deoxynucleotides with alternating deoxycytosine and deoxyadenosine (Chol-PS-d(CA)7C). Homopolymers with 15 deoxycytosine (Chol-PS-dC15) or deoxythymidine (Chol-PS-dT15) residues were approximately 2-fold less inhibitory than Chol-PS-d(CA)7C. The relative potency of transport inhibition by deoxycytosine oligomers of varying length was: Chol-PS-dC5 &gt; Chol-PS-dC15 &gt; Chol-PS-dC28 &gt; Chol-PS-dC3. Substantial inhibition was retained in cells preincubated with inhibitors and washed prior to transport determinations and the inhibitor sensitivity could be increased substantially by reducing the concentration of cells. Mixed competitive and non-competitive inhibition was observed for each analog. In standard high-folate medium, Chol-PS-oligodeoxynucleotides (5.0 microM) had minimal effects on the growth of L1210 cells, but antagonized the cytotoxicity of methotrexate. The response to methotrexate (IC50 = 12 nM) decreased to the greatest extent (20.8-fold) in the presence of Chol-PS-d(CA)7C (IC50 = 250 nM). Under limiting folate conditions, Chol-PS-d(CA)7C alone inhibited cells growth by a process which could be reversed by folic acid. The results show that Chol-PS-oligodeoxynucleotides are among the most potent known inhibitors of the reduced-folate carrier. Direct growth inhibition of folate-deficient cells and antagonism of methotrexate cytotoxicity indicate that Chol-PS-oligodeoxynucleotides retain the ability to inhibit the reduced-folate carrier for several days in cultured cells."
856,1995,5' contexts of Escherichia coli and human termination codons are similar.,"The nearest 5' context of 2559 human stop codons was analysed in comparison with the same context of stop-like codons (UGG, UGC, UGU, CGA for UGA; CAA, UAU, UAC for UAA; and UGG, UAU, UAC, CAG for UAG). The non-random distribution of some nucleotides upstream of the stop codons was observed. For instance, uridine is over-represented in position -3 upstream of UAG. Several codons were shown to be over-represented immediately upstream of the stop codons: UUU(Phe), AGC(Ser), and the Lys and Ala codon families before UGA; AAG(Lys), GCG(Ala), and the Ser and Leu codon families before UAA; and UCA(Ser), AUG(Met), and the Phe codon family before UAG. In contrast, the Thr and Gly codon families were under-represented before UGA, while ACC(Thr) and the Gly codon family were under-represented before UAG and UAA respectively. In an earlier study, uridine was shown to be over-represented in position -3 before UGA in Escherichia coli [Arkov,A.L., Korolev,S.V. and Kisselev,L.L. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res., 21,2891-2897]. In that study, the codons for Lys, Phe and Ser were shown to be over-represented immediately upstream of E. coli stop codons. Consequently, E. coli and human termination codons have similar 5' contexts. The present study suggests that the 5' context of stop codons may modulate the efficiency of peptide chain termination and (or) stop codon readthrough in higher eukaryotes, and that the mechanisms of such a modulation in prokaryotes and higher eukaryotes may be very similar."
857,1995,5' untranslated leader sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs encoding heat shock induced proteins.,"5' untranslated leaders (5' UTLs) are suggested to play a crucial role in the selective translation of their eukaryotic mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins (HSP) during heat stress conditions. However, the structural features of the HSP mRNAs which cause this effect are mostly unknown. We have compiled the 5' UTLs from about 140 eukaryotic HSP mRNAs including vertebrates, invertebrates, higher and lower plants. A detailed analysis of these sequences according to length, A+T content, context of functional ATGs and presence of upstream non-functional ATGs was made. We observed that all these features were similar to the earlier studies in the literature based on data from HSP as well as non-HSP mRNAs. These observations were reconfirmed by intra-specific comparison of 5' UTLs from HSP and non-HSP genes. Similar to the translation element involved in the selective translation of mRNAs in polioviruses, a search for a short sequence motif complementary to highly conserved 18S rRNA was performed using a HSP mRNA database. The majority of the HSP mRNA sequences (77%) contained one or more small sequence motifs suggesting that they may function as internal ribosome entry sites for selective initiation of translation during heat stress."
858,1995,"5' upstream sequences of MyD88, an IL-6 primary response gene in M1 cells: detection of functional IRF-1 and Stat factors binding sites.","Transcription regulatory elements have been analyzed in upstream sequences of an Interleukin-6 (Il-6) primary response gene, MyD88. MyD88 2.3 kb mRNA is strongly and persistently induced in the course of myeloleukemic M1 cells differentiation with Il-6. MyD88 cDNA sequences were found in a region of 12 kb of mouse genomic DNA. Using Il-6 treated M1 cell RNAs, two transcription start sites have been localized, approximately 100 bp upstream from the 5' end of the cloned cDNA. We sequenced 1.4 kb of 5' genomic DNA including the first exon. In 5' of mRNA transcription start site, MyD88 nucleotidic sequence is 85% identical to 5' complementary sequences of the rat 3'-ketoacetyl CoA thiolase gene, over 1.2 kb. A DNA element conferring Il-6-inducible transcription to reporter genes, and localized 30 bp upstream of MyD88 first RNA start site, contains overlapping binding sites for cytokine activated transcription factors Stat and for the Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 and -2 (IRF-1 and IRF-2). In vitro binding assays showed that attachment of Stat factors to this element early in Il-6 treatment requires tyrosine kinase activation. IRF1, an activator of transcription, is also induced to bind to this sequence at later times. A model of persistent activation of MyD88 gene through these two types of factors is proposed.Images"

UV thermal denaturation studies and CD spectroscopy of 1:1 mixtures of these oligomers and a 21 mer target duplex [d(C3A7GA7C3)-d(G3T7CT7G3), D1] with a complementary purine tract showed a nearly pH-independent (6.0-8.0) triple helix formation with melting temperatures of 21-19 degrees C and 18.5-17.5 degrees C, respectively (buffer system: 50 mM sodium cacodylate, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2). In contrast, with the corresponding 15mer deoxy-C-containing oligonucleotide [d(T(7)1T7), S1] triplex formation was observed only below pH 6.6. Specificity for the recognition of Watson-Crick GC-base pairs was observed by pairing the modified C-bases of the 15mers with all other possible Watson-Crick-base compositions in the target duplex [d(C3A7XA7C3)-d(G3T7YT7G3), X = A,C,T; Y = T,G,A, D2-4].

The single-stranded ras gene fragment was used as a template for in vitro DNA synthesis with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, Taq DNA polymerase, rat DNA polymerase beta and mouse DNA polymerase alpha. The former two enzymes exclusively incorporated dTMP opposite OH8Ade. The DNA polymerases alpha and beta misinserted dGMP, and dAMP and dGMP, respectively. The c-Ha-ras gene was constructed using the double-stranded ras gene fragment containing OH8Ade and was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. The gene with OH8Ade induced focus formation, indicating that OH8Ade elicited point mutations in cells. When c-Ha-ras genes present in transformed cells were analyzed, an A--&gt;G transition and an A--&gt;C transversion were detected. These results indicate that OH8Ade induced misincorporation in in vitro DNA synthesis and mutations in mammalian cells.Images"

The entire R-M system of EcoHK311 is located in a 2.1 kb fragment. R.EcoHK311 is an isoschizomer of Eael which recognizes and cleaves Y decreases GGCCR. M.EcoHK31l consists of two polypeptides alpha and beta with sizes 309 and 176 aa, respectively. Polypeptide beta is encoded within aa, alternative reading frame of polypeptide alpha. All the conserved motifs in mC5-MTases can be found in polypeptide alpha except motif IX which is present in polypeptide beta. Polypeptides alpha and beta were separately synthesized in a T7 promoter controlled over-expression system and in vitro methylation occurred only when the two extracts were mixed and thus confirms that two polypeptides are required for methylation.Images"
865,1995,Aberrant pre-mRNA maturation is caused by LINE insertions into introns of the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster.,"Insertional mutagenesis screens have provided thousands of mutant alleles for analysing genes of varied functions in Drosophila melanogaster. We here document mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis by a LINE element, the I factor, by determining the molecular structure of RNAs produced from two alleles of the white gene of D.melanogaster, wIR1 and wIR6. These alleles result from insertion of the I factor into introns of the gene. We show that sequences present within the element direct aberrant splicing and termination events. When the I factor is inserted within the white first intron it may lead to the use of a cryptic 3' splice site which does not contain the dinucleotide AG. This splicing gives rise to a chimeric messenger RNA whose synthesis is controlled differently in tissues where the mutated gene is expressed. When the I factor is inserted within the white last intron it induces synthesis of truncated mRNAs. These results provide, for the first time, mechanisms for I factor insertional mutagenesis. They are discussed in the more general context of RNA processing in Drosophila and the evolution of eukaryotic gene introns.Images"

867,1995,A broadly applicable continuous spectrophotometric assay for measuring aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity.,"We describe a convenient, simple and novel continuous spectrophotometric method for the determination of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity. The assay relies upon the measurement of inorganic pyrophosphate generated in the first step of the aminoacylation of a tRNA. Pyrophosphate release is coupled to inorganic pyrophosphatase, to generate phosphate, which in turn is used as the substrate of purine nucleoside phosphorylase to catalyze the N-glycosidic cleavage of 2-amino 6-mercapto 7-methylpurine ribonucleoside. Of the reaction products, ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino 6-mercapto 7-methylpurine, the latter has a high absorbance at 360 nm relative to the nucleoside and hence provides a spectrophotometric signal that can be continuously followed. The non-destructive nature of the spectrophotometric assay allowed the re-use of the tRNAs in question in successive experiments. The usefulness of this method was demonstrated for glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. Initial velocities measured using this assay correlate closely with those assayed by quantitation of [3H]Gln-tRNA or [14C]Trp-tRNA formation respectively. In both cases amino acid transfer from the aminoacyl adenylate to the tRNA represents the rate determining step. In addition, aminoacyl adenylate formation by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was followed and provided a more sensitive means of active site titration than existing techniques. Finally, this novel method was used to provide direct evidence for the cooperativity of tRNA and ATP binding to GlnRS."
868,1995,Abrogation of mercuric chloride-induced nephritis in the Brown Norway rat by treatment with antibodies against TNFë±,"HgCl2 induces an autoimmune disease in the Brown Norway rat characterized by synthesis of autoantibodies (mainly, anti-GBM Abs), severe proteinuria and interstitial nephritis. Also, HgCl2- injected rats develop glomerular cell infiltrates consisting of ED1+ cells (monocyte/macrophage), starting on day 4 and reaching a maximum on day 8. Treatment with anti-TNF-ë± antiserum had preventative effects as it reduced the urinary protein levels to close to the normal range and also blocked the influx of inflammatory cells in the renal glomeruli and interstitium, but circulating anti-GBM and lineal glomerular IgG deposits were unmodified. In addition, whole isolated glomeruli from HgCl2-induced nephritis secreted TNF-ë± commencing on day 8, being maximally detected on day 11 and preceding, between 2 to 3 days, the development of proteinuria. The administration of anti-TNF-ë± antiserum or anti-ë±4 integrin mAb completely abrogated the synthesis of TNF-ë± in glomeruli isolated from the respective treated groups of animals, in addition to the proteinuria. Taken together our results confirm that TNF-ë± plays an important role in the induction and development of HgCl2-induced nephritis and highlights the pathogenic importance of the local release of TNF in those renal diseases in which prominent glomerular macrophage accumulation is a constant feature."

A protein, EBF, was identified and partially purified which binds to the enhancers and to several other sequences within the IGS, but not to other DNA fragments, including the rRNA core promoter. No consensus binding sequence could be discerned in these fragments and bound factor is in rapid equilibrium with unbound. EBF has functional characteristics similar to vertebrate upstream binding factors (UBF). Not only does it bind to the enhancer and other IGS elements, but it also stimulates binding of TIF-IB, the fundamental transcription initiation factor, to the core promoter and stimulates transcription from the promoter. Attempts to identify polypeptides with epitopes similar to rat or Xenopus laevis UBF suggest that structurally the protein from A.castellanii is not closely related to vertebrate UBF.Images"
874,1995,Accurate and efficient N-6-adenosine methylation in spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA by HeLa cell extract in vitro.,"Human U6 small nuclear RNA (U6 snRNA), an abundant snRNA required for splicing of pre-mRNAs, contains several post-transcriptional modifications including a single m6A (N-6-methyladenosine) at position 43. This A-43 residue is critical for the function of U6 snRNA in splicing of pre-mRNAs. Yeast and plant U6 snRNAs also contain m6A in the corresponding position showing that this modification is evolutionarily conserved. In this study, we show that upon incubation of an unmodified U6 RNA with HeLa cell extract, A-43 residue in human U6 snRNA was rapidly converted to m6A-43. This conversion was detectable as early as 3 min after incubation and was nearly complete in 60 min; no other A residue in U6 snRNA was converted to m6A. Deletion studies showed that the stem-loop structure near the 5' end of U6 snRNA is dispensable for m6A formation; however, the integrity of the 3' stem-loop was necessary for efficient m6A formation. These data show that a short stretch of primary sequence flanking the methylation site is not sufficient for U6 m6A methyltransferase recognition and the enzyme probably recognizes secondary and/or tertiary structural features in U6 snRNA. The enzyme that catalyzes m6A formation in U6 snRNA appears to be distinct from the prolactin mRNA methyltransferase which is also present in HeLa nuclear extracts.Images"
875,1995,A change of IL-2 and IL-4 production in patients with Helicobactor pylori infection,"Hellcobacter pylori is the most common cause of gastroduodenal inflammation. However, the exact immune pathogenesis is not fully understood. To look for evidence of the immunological mechanism in H. pylori associated disease, we measured cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 levels produced by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and gastric biopsies in 20 subjects with or without H. pylori infection. H. pylori can stimulate IL-2 and IL-4 production from PBL in H. pylori negative as well as H. pylori positive individuals. The spontaneous IL-2 production by PBL and gastric biopsies was greater (p &lt; 0.0025, &lt;0.001)in H. pylori negative individuals than that in H. pylori infected patients. Increased IL-4 levels from PBL in H. pylori infected patients were found in the presence of H. pylori (p &lt; 0.0025). An increased spontaneous production of IL-4 from gastric biopsies was also observed in H. pylori infected patients (p &lt; 0.025). In conclusion, an enhanced type 2 cytokine production was observed in H. pylori infected patients, which may be responsible for H. pylori chronic infection."
876,1995,A Common Stem Cell for Murine Cortical and Medullary Thymic Epithelial Cells?,"We have addressed the question whether the epithelial stroma in the thymus is derived from a common stem cell or whether cortical and medullary epithelial cells are derived from different embryonic stem cells emerging, for example, from endoderm and ectoderm. By the use of rapidly expanding cultures of thymic epithelial cells (TEC) from 14 to 16 day-old murine fetuses and by specific antibodies against cortical and medullary epithelium, respectively, we were able to demonstrate a small subpopulation of double-labeled TEC in the cultures. These cells were not present in TEC cultures initiated from thymuses of neonatal mice. Double-labeled TEC were also found in tissue sections from fetal thymuses. These findings may indicate that TEC populations of the cortex and the medulla are derived from a common stem cell, with potential for differentiation toward both cortical and medullary TEC."
877,1995,A comparison of the different DNA binding specificities of the bZip proteins C/EBP and GCN4.,"The bZip proteins GCN4 and C/EBP differ in their DNA binding specificities: GCN4 binds well to the pseudopalindromic AP1 site 5'-A4T3G2A1C0T1C2'A3'T4'-3' and to the palindromic ATF/CREB sequence 5'-A4T3G2A1-C0*G0'T1'C2'A3'T4'-3'; C/EBP preferentially recognizes the palindromic sequence 5'-A4T3T2G1C0*G0'C1'A2'-A3'T4'-3'. According to the X-ray structures of GCN4-DNA complexes, five residues of the basic region of GCN4 are involved in specific base contacts: asparagine -18, alanine -15, alanine -14, serine -11 and arginine -10 (numbered relative to the start point of the leucine zipper, which we define as +1). In the basic region of C/EBP position -14 is occupied by valine instead of alanine, the other four residues being identical. Here we analyse the role of valine -14 in C/EBP-DNA complex formation. Starting from a C/EBP-GCN4 chimeric bZip peptide which displays C/EBP specificity, we systematically mutated position -14 of its basic region and characterized the DNA binding specificities of the 20 possible different peptides by gel mobility shift assays with various target sites. We present evidence that valine -14 of C/EBP interacts more strongly with thymine 2 than with cytosine 1' of the C/EBP binding site, unlike the corresponding alanine -14 of GCN4, which exclusively contacts thymine 1' of the GCN4 binding sites.Images"
878,1995,A comparison of the hairpin stability of the palindromic d(CGCG(A/T)4CGCG) oligonucleotides.,"The palindromic deoxyribonucleotides 5'-CGCGA-TATCGCG-3' and 5'-CGCGTTAACGCG-3' have been characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The NMR data identified both B-DNA duplex conformations and hairpin conformations, the latter with loop regions consisting of the four central nucleotides. The resonances of the various conformations were assigned by use of two-dimensional NMR methods. The relative stability of the various conformations was investigated as a function of temperature, ionic strength and nucleotide concentration. The duplexes were found to be stabilized at high ionic strength and at low temperature, while the hairpins were stabilized at low ionic strength and at medium temperature. The thermodynamics of the duplex-hairpin and the hairpin-random coil transitions were examined, and compared to the other two oligonucleotide in the palindromic d(CGCG(A/T)4CGCG) oligonucleotide family. The relative stabilities of the duplex conformations with respect to the random coil conformations are similar for the d(CGCGAATTCGCG), d(CGCGATATCGCG) and d(CGCGTATACGCG) oligonucleotides. The duplex conformation of d(CGCGTTAACGCG) is less stable. The hairpin of d(CGCGTTAACGCG) seems also to be less stable relative to the random coil conformation than in the case of the other oligonucleotides at an equal oligonucleotide concentration. A cruciform intermediate between the duplex and hairpin conformations is suggested to explain some discrepancies observed in this work in case of the d(CGCGTTAACGCG) oligonucleotide. This is similar to what has been reported for the d(CGCGTATACGCG) oligonucleotide."
879,1995,A comparison of the in vitro activity of DNA-armed and all-RNA hammerhead ribozymes.,"Hammerhead ribozymes targeted against two unrelated RNA substrates have been prepared. For each substrate, four ribozymes, differing in their hybridising arm length and composition (DNA or RNA), have been synthesised and kinetically characterised. The presence of DNA in the hybridising arms had little effect on the overall cleavage rate when the cleavage step was rate determining. Shortening each of the hybridising arms of ribozymes from 10 to 6 nucleotides generally resulted in modest changes in rate constants for cleavage of the same 13mer substrate. In one case the presence of long RNA hybridising arms significantly impeded the cleavage reaction. Cleavage rates displayed first order dependence on hydroxide ion concentration at low pHs. At higher pH, some ribozymes deviated from this first order dependence because of a change in the rate-determining step, possibly due to a requirement for a conformation change in the ribozyme-substrate complex prior to cleavage. Ribozyme cleavage was strongly dependent on temperature in the range 5-45 degrees C, with an activation energy for the reaction of approximately 60 kJ mol-1. The ribozymes displayed biphasic dependence on magnesium ion concentration; evidence of strong apparent binding (Kd approximately 10 mM) as well as a looser interaction was observed for all ribozymes."
880,1995,A compilation of composite regulatory elements affecting gene transcription in vertebrates.,"Over the past years, evidence has been accumulating for a fundamental role of protein-protein interactions between transcription factors in gene-specific transcription regulation. Many of these interactions run within composite elements containing binding sites for several factors. We have selected 101 composite regulatory elements identified experimentally in the regulatory regions of 64 genes of vertebrates and of their viruses and briefly described them in a compilation. Of these, 82 composite elements are of the synergistic type and 19 of the antagonistic type. Within the synergistic type composite elements, transcription factors bind to the corresponding sites simultaneously, thus cooperatively activating transcription. The factors, binding to their target sites within antagonistic type composite elements, produce opposing effects on transcription. The nucleotide sequence and localization in the genes, the names and brief description of transcription factors, are provided for each composite element, including a representation of experimental data on its functioning. Most of the composite elements (3/4) fall between -250 bp and the transcription start site. The distance between the binding sites within the composite elements described varies from complete overlapping to 80 bp. The compilation of composite elements is presented in the database COMPEL which is electronically accessible by anonymous ftp via internet."

883,1995,Activation of a muscle-specific enhancer by the Ski proto-oncogene.,"In transgenic mice, muscle-specific expression of the c-ski oncogene induces hypertrophy exclusively in a subset of fast muscle fibers. Here we report that regulatory elements from two genes expressed in fast fibers, myosin light chain 1/3 (MLC) and muscle creatine kinase (MCK), were activated when co-transfected with c-ski expression vectors in myoblasts. The expression from the MLC enhancer was reduced when the c-ski oncogene was cotransfected with MyoD into NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Activation of the MLC enhancer by Ski also occurred in vivo, since bigenic progeny generated by mating MLC-CAT and MSV-skitransgenic mice displayed higher CAT activity in their muscles than did the MLC-CAT parental line. Identification of gene targets for the fiber-specific action of the c-ski gene product provides a molecular model that could be used for the further dissection of Ski-induced hypertrophy, both in tissue culture and in vivo.Images"

885,1995,Activation of mammalian ribosomal gene transcription requires phosphorylation of the nucleolar transcription factor UBF.,"The nucleolar factor UBF is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) at serine residues within the C-terminal acidic domain which is required for transcription activation. To investigate the biological significance of UBF modification, we have compared the trans-activating properties of cellular UBF and recombinant UBF expressed in Escherichia coli. Using a variety of assays we demonstrate that unphosphorylated UBF is transcriptionally inactive and has to be phosphorylated at multiple sites to stimulate transcription. Examination of cDNA mutants in which the serine residues within the C-terminal domain were altered by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that CKII-mediated phosphorylations of UBF contribute to, but are not sufficient for, transcriptional activation. Besides CKII, other cellular protein kinases phosphorylate UBF at distinct sites in a growth-dependent manner. The marked differences in the tryptic peptide maps of UBF from growing and serum-starved cells suggest that alterations in the degree of UBF phosphorylation may modulate rRNA synthetic activity in response to extracellular signals.Images"
886,1995,Activation of transfer RNA-guanine ribosyltransferase by protein kinase C.,"Transfer RNA-guanine ribosyltransferase (TGRase) irreversibly incorporates queuine into the first position in the anticodon of four tRNA isoacceptors. Rat brain protein kinase C (PKC) was shown to stimulate rat liver TGRase activity. TGRase preparations derived from rat liver have been observed to decrease in activity over time in storage at -20 or -70 degrees C. Contamination of the samples by phosphatases was indicated by a p-nitrophenylphosphate conversion test. The addition of micromolar concentrations of the phosphatase inhibitors sodium pyrophosphate and sodium fluoride into TGRase isolation buffers resulted in a greater return of TGRase activity than without these inhibitors. Inactive TGRase preparations were reactivated to their original activity with the addition of PKC. In assays combining both TGRase and PKC enzymes, inhibitors of protein kinase C (sphingosine, staurosporine, H-7 and calphostin C) all blocked the reactivation of TGRase, whereas activators of protein kinase C (calcium, diacylglycerol and phosphatidyl serine) increased the activity of TGRase. None of the PKC modulators affected TGRase activity directly. Alkaline phosphatase, when added to assays, decreased the activity of TGRase and also blocked the reactivation of TGRase with PKC. Denaturing PAGE and autoradiography was performed on TGRase isolates that had been labelled with 32P by PKC. The resulting strong 60 kDa band (containing the major site for phosphorylation) and weak 34.5 kDa band (containing the TGRase activity) are suggested to associate to make up a 104 kDa heterodimer that comprises the TGRase enzyme. This was corroberated by native and denaturing size-exclusion chromatography. These results suggest that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of TGRase is tied to efficient enzymatic function and therefore control of the queuine modification of tRNA.Images"
887,1995,Adipose tissue as a medium for epidemiologic exposure assessment.,"In the United States, adipose tissue is rarely used as a medium for assessment of prior exposures in epidemiologic studies. Adipose tissue aspirations are in general less invasive and carry less risk than phlebotomy. Tissue samples can be analyzed for a wide number of epidemiologically important exposures. Beyond reflecting long-term energy balance, this tissue offers a relatively stable depot of triglyceride and fat-soluble substances, such as fat-soluble vitamins, and pesticides. As a tissue it represents the greatest reservoir of carotenoids in the body. Halogenated hydrocarbons may be measured in concentrations of hundreds-fold greater than those in blood of the same individuals. The composition of adipose tissue also reflects the long-term dietary intakes of a number of essential fatty acids. The turnover times of all of these substances in adipose tissue remain under-researched. Sampling and storage of adipose tissue, homogeneity of sampling sites, turnover times, and the effects of diet, age, gender, race, hormones, and disease on adipose tissue composition are discussed in this review of current knowledge about adipose tissue stability. Experience in the use of adipose tissue sampling in epidemiologic studies in various countries has shown that it is simple to conduct, requires little training, carries little risk, and does not result in excessive participant refusal."
888,1995,A DNA binding factor (UBF) interacts with a positive regulatory element in the promoters of genes expressed during meiosis and vegetative growth in yeast.,"We have studied the bipartite regulatory element UASH/URS1 in the promoter of HOP1, whose product is required for synapsis and correct pairing of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. HOP1 is transcriptionally repressed by the URS1 motif during vegetative growth and induced during meiotic prophase by the UASH motif in cooperation with the bifunctional URS1 site, which is required for full induction of HOP1. While URS1 is bound in vitro by the Buf and Ume6 repressor proteins, we demonstrate for the first time by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and interference footprinting that the UASH site interacts in vitro with a novel factor called UBF (UASH binding factor) which is present in haploid and diploid cycling, as well as sporulating cells. Point mutations in the HOP1 UASH motif abolish UBF-dependent DNA binding activity in vitro and meiotic HOP1 gene expression in vivo. Furthermore, we show that UBF binds in vitro to UASH-like sequences in the promoter regions of several meiosis-specific and non-specific genes and propose that UBF mediates gene expression through its interaction with the UASH motif in both cycling and sporulating cells.Images"
889,1995,A DNase from the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata.,"We have purified to homogeneity a DNase from a Crithidia fasciculata crude mitochondrial lysate. The enzyme is present in two forms, either as a 32 kDa polypeptide or as a multimer containing the 32 kDa polypeptide in association with a 56 kDa polypeptide. Native molecular weight measurements indicate that these forms are a monomer and possibly an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, respectively. The monomeric and multimeric forms of the enzyme are similar in their catalytic activities. Both digest double-stranded DNA about twice as efficiently as single-stranded DNA. They introduce single-strand breaks into a supercoiled plasmid but do not efficiently make double-strand breaks. They degrade a linearized plasmid more efficiently than a nickel plasmid. Both enzymes degrade a 5'-32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide to completion, with the 5'-terminal nucleotide ultimately being released as a 5'-mononucleotide. One difference between the monomeric and multimeric forms of the enzyme, demonstrated by a band shift assay, is that the multimeric form binds tightly to double-stranded DNA, possibly aggregating it.Images"
890,1995,Aerobic and anaerobic PCB biodegradation in the environment.,"Studies have identified two distinct biological processes capable of biotransforming polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): aerobic oxidative processes and anaerobic reductive processes. It is now known that these two complementary activities are occurring naturally in the environment. Anaerobic PCB dechlorination, responsible for the conversion of highly chlorinated PCBs to lightly chlorinated ortho-enriched congeners, has been documented extensively in the Hudson River and has been observed at many other sites throughout the world. The products from this anaerobic process are readily degradable by a wide range of aerobic bacteria, and it has now been shown that this process is occurring in surficial sediments in the Hudson River. The widespread anaerobic dechlorination of PCBs that has been observed in many river and marine sediments results in reduction of both the potential risk from and potential exposure to PCBs. The reductions in potential risk include reduced dioxinlike toxicity and reduced carcinogenicity. The reduced PCB exposure realized upon dechlorination is manifested by reduced bioaccumulation in the food chain and by the increased anaerobic degradability of these products."
891,1995,A family of cold-regulated RNA-binding protein genes in the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis M3.,"I previously found a cold-regulated RNA-binding protein gene rbpA (now named rbpA1) in Anabaena variabilis M3 [Sato, N. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. 24, 819-823]. I show here that this gene is a member of a gene family containing at least eight members as evidenced by Southern blot and immunoblot analyses. I have isolated three additional genes (rbpB, rbpC and rbpD) in this family. Of these, rbpB was 100% identical to the rbpB gene of Anabaena 7120 reported previously. Another gene named rbpA in Anabaena 7120 was also found to exist in A.variabilis M3 with identical sequence and named rbpA2. The amino acid sequences of these gene products were highly conserved, except that the RbpD protein lacked glycine-rich C-terminal domain present in all other known members of the gene family. RNA blot and immunoblot analyses showed that the expression of rbpA1, rbpA2, rbpB, rbpC and rbpD, as well as uncloned rbp genes was regulated by cold, though the exact time-course and extent of response to cold were different among these genes. Gel-filtration assay showed that all of the Rbp proteins have higher affinities to poly(G) and poly(U) than to poly(A) and poly(C).Images"
892,1995,AFLP: a new technique for DNA fingerprinting.,"A novel DNA fingerprinting technique called AFLP is described. The AFLP technique is based on the selective PCR amplification of restriction fragments from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification of sets of restriction fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets of restriction fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers of restriction fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50-100 restriction fragments are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity.Images"
893,1995,A frameshift error detection algorithm for DNA sequencing projects.,"During the determination of DNA sequences, frameshift errors are not the most frequent but they are the most bothersome as they corrupt the amino acid sequence over several residues. Detection of such errors by sequence alignment is only possible when related sequences are found in the databases. To avoid this limitation, we have developed a new tool based on the distribution of non-overlapping 3-tuples or 6-tuples in the three frames of an ORF. The method relies upon the result of a correspondence analysis. It has been extensively tested on Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequences and has also been examined with human sequences. The results indicate that it can detect frameshift errors affecting as few as 20 bp with a low rate of false positives (no more than 1.0/1000 bp scanned). The proposed algorithm can be used to scan a large collection of data, but it is mainly intended for laboratory practice as a tool for checking the quality of the sequences produced during a sequencing project."
894,1995,A fully automated flow injection atomic absorption system for the determination of copper traces in waters with on-line pre-concentration in an ion-exchange column,"The paper describes the development of an automatic on-line column pre-concentration technique using a time based-flow injection atomic absorption spectrometry system. A manifold incorporating a micro-column containing 25 mg of Dowex 50W-X8 was used with a time-based injector for the pre-concentration and determination of copper in natural and drinking waters. The system features depend on the alternate positions of a solenoid valve. The 3ìÄ detection limits, enrichment factors, sampling frequency, relative standard deviations and linear calibration graphs were, respectively, in the range 0.6-1.5 ë_g/l, 25-60, 15-30 measurements/h, 1.0-3.1% and 1-65 ë_g/ml for pre-concentration times of 1 min. The procedure was successfully applied to a range of water samples and the accuracy was assessed through recovery experiments, the analysis of certified reference water samples and by independent analysis by atomic absorption spectrometry with electrothermal atomization."
895,1995,A functional p53-responsive intronic promoter is contained within the human mdm2 gene.,"The mdm2 gene is a target for transcriptional activation by the p53 tumor suppressor gene product. Previous work has revealed that the mouse mdm2 gene contains two promoters: one is located upstream to the gene and is active in the absence of p53, the other resides within the first intron and requires p53 for transcriptional activity. To determine whether this unique promoter activation pattern is biologically important, we investigated the structure and function of the corresponding region of the human mdm2 (hmdm2) gene. We report here that the hmdm2 gene also contains an intronic, p53-dependent promoter. The structural features of this promoter are highly conserved between mouse and man, as opposed to the lack of conservation of the first exon. This promoter is triggered in vivo in the presence of activated wild type p53, leading to the production of novel mRNA species. The intronic hmdm2 promoter contains two tandem p53 binding elements. Deletion analysis suggests that optimal promoter activity requires the simultaneous binding of p53 to both elements; this may serve to prevent premature triggering of the promoter by p53.Images"
896,1995,A genetic algorithm based molecular modeling technique for RNA stem-loop structures.,"A new modeling technique for arriving at the three dimensional (3-D) structure of an RNA stem-loop has been developed based on a conformational search by a genetic algorithm and the following refinement by energy minimization. The genetic algorithm simultaneously optimizes a population of conformations in the predefined conformational space and generates 3-D models of RNA. The fitness function to be optimized by the algorithm has been defined to reflect the satisfaction of known conformational constraints. In addition to a term for distance constraints, the fitness function contains a term to constrain each local conformation near to a prepared template conformation. The technique has been applied to the two loops of tRNA, the anticodon loop and the T-loop, and has found good models with small root mean square deviations from the crystal structure. Slightly different models have also been found for the anticodon loop. The analysis of a collection of alternative models obtained has revealed statistical features of local variations at each base position.Images"
897,1995,A gene-type-specific enhancer regulates the carbamyl phosphate synthetase I promoter by cooperating with the proximal GAG activating element.,"The rat carbamyl phosphate synthetase I gene is expressed in two cell types: hepatocytes and epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa. The proximal promoter contains a single activating element, GAG, two repressor elements (sites I and III) and an anti-repressor element (site II). Although these elements together exhibit the potential for complex regulation, they are unable to confer tissue-specific promoter activity. Here we have identified a cell-type-specific enhancer that lies 10 kilobases upstream of the promoter. Unexpectedly, the enhancer also functioned in a gene-type-specific manner. The enhancer stimulated promoter activity exclusively through the proximal GAG element. Abrogation of GAG, either directly by mutation of GAG or indirectly by sites I and III repressors, abolished enhancer activation. Conversely, activation of the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter by the enhancer required the introduction of GAG. The requirement for GAG, therefore, functions to constrain the enhancer to a specific target promoter."

899,1995,Age-specific carcinogenesis: environmental exposure and susceptibility.,"Environmental exposures in children may occur through many routes, including diet, air, and the ingestion of various nonfood items such as medications and household materials. This article focuses on dietary exposure, but it does highlight the importance of considering other routes of exposure when assessing exposure in children. It presents many of the findings in the two recent reports, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children and Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)/National Research Council (NRC). Diet is an important source of exposure for children to potential carcinogens. The trace quantities of chemicals present on or in foodstuffs are termed residues. In addition, there are substances that children may be exposed to in air and water that should be considered in a total exposure analysis. To minimize exposure of the general population to chemical residues in food, water, and air, the U.S. government has instituted regulatory controls. These are intended to limit exposures to residues while ensuring an abundant and nutritious food supply, and safe drinking water and air. The legislative framework for these controls was established by the Congress through various local and state laws and such federal laws as the Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Clean Air Act (CAA). This article summarizes current approaches to assessing exposure and susceptibility in children."
900,1995,Age-specific oncogenesis: the genetics of cancer susceptibility.,"Cancer is considered to be a multifactorial disease in which a host cell is transformed from normal to malignant as a result of complex interactions of external (environmental) stimuli and cancer-predisposing or cancer-suppressing genes. Although certain chemical carcinogens and ionizing radiation are known to cause specific alterations at the level of the gene, other correlations are less clear. Not infrequently, cancer is found to aggregate in families in an apparently nonrandom fashion. It has been through the study of such families that our understanding of the genetic events leading to cancer has developed. Both common and rare tumors may occur together in familial-cancer families. Frequently, tumors occur at an earlier age than one would expect in the general population; often, multiple tumors of different organs develop in a particular affected family member. Recent advances in the genetics of familial cancer syndromes have led to the possibility to perform genetic testing on unaffected relatives who might carry a genetic defect that predisposes them to cancer. Complex ethical, social, and legal implications arise from these new technical advances."

902,1996,18S rRNA processing requires the RNA helicase-like protein Rrp3.,"We report the identification of a new gene, RRP3 (rRNA processing), which is required for pre-rRNA processing. Rrp3 is a 60.9 kDa protein that is required for maturation of the 35S primary transcript of pre-rRNA and is required for cleavages leading to mature 18S RNA. RRP3 was identified in a PCR screen for DEAD box genes. DEAD box genes are part of a large family of proteins homologous to the eukaryotic transcription factor elF-4a. Most of these proteins are RNA-dependent ATPases and some of them have RNA helicase activity. This is the third yeast DEAD box protein that has been shown to be involved in rRNA assembly, but the only one required for the processing of 18S RNA. Mutants of the two other putative helicases, Spb4 and Drsl, both show processing defects in 25S rRNA maturation. In strains where Rrp3 is depleted, 35S precursor RNA is improperly processed. Cleavage normally occurs at sites A0O, Al and A2, but in the Rrp3 depletion stain cleavage occurs between A2 and B1. Rrp3 has been purified to homogeneity and has a weak RNA-dependent ATPase activity which is not specific for rRNA."
903,1996,18 Years of Experience in Knee Arthroscopy Under Local Anesthesia,"Today, arthroscopies of the knee joint have become a routine procedure. Generally, these operations are performed under general or spinal anesthesia. In Rheinfelden, local anesthesia is our method of choice. We will summarize our experience with nearly 9000 arthroscopies in the last 18 years. We use 10 mls of ScandicainR as the local anesthetic for the puncture track, followed by an intraarticular injection of 20 mls of CarbostesinR. From 1977 to 1994, arthroscopies were performed on 8720 patients, of which 90% were outpatients, under local anesthesia. When asked about pain sensation, 50% of patients had no pain at all, 34% expressed mild pain and only 3% reported strong pain. 90% of all patients questioned responded that they would undergo the same procedure a second time, if necessary. There are several advantages of local anesthesia, most important the minimal invasive procedure. Risk factors can be avoided, the pain level described by the patients is acceptable and the costs are lower than with other anesthetizing techniques. As a prerequisite for performing these operations under local anesthesia, the surgeon must be very experienced in the handling and routine of arthroscopic procedures."

905,1996,1H NMR studies of the 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine containing TF1 binding site.,"The pyrimidine base 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (HmU) is a common nucleotide in SPO1 phage DNA. Numerous transcriptional proteins bind HmU-containing DNA preferentially implicating a regulatory function of HmU. We have investigated the conformation and dynamics of d-(5'-CHmUCHmUACACGHmUGHmUAGAG-OH-3')2 (HmU-DNA). This oligonucleotide mimics the consensus sequence of Transcription Factor 1 (TF1). The HmU-DNA was compared to the thymine-containing oligonucleotide. NOESY and DQF COSY spectroscopy provided resonance assignments of nonexchangeable and exchangeable protons, intranucleotide, internucleotide and intrastrand proton-proton distances, and dihedral angle constraints. Methylene protons of the hydroxymethyl group are nonequivalent protons and the hydroxymethyl group is not freely rotating. The hydroxymethyl group adopts a specific orientation with the OH group oriented on the 3' side of the plane of the base. Analysis of imino proton resonances and NOEs indicates additional end base pair fraying and a temperature-induced transition to a conformation in which the internal HmU-A base pairs are disrupted or have reduced lifetimes. Orientation of the hydroxymethyl group indicates the presence of internucleotide intrastrand hydrogen bonding between the HmU12C5 hydroxyl group and A13. All sugars in both DNAs show a C2'endo conformation (typical of B-DNA)."

The corresponding N nucleoside was isolated by different enzymatic and chromatographic protocols from a partially purified preparation of this tRNA(Leu). Its chemical characterization was determined from its chromatographic properties, UV-absorption spectroscopy and mass spectrometric measurements, as well as from those of the borohydride reduced N nucleoside and its etheno-trimethylsilyl derivative. The structure of N was established as 2'-O-methyl-5-formylcytidine (f5CM), and its reduced derivative as 2'-O-methyl-5-hydroxy-methylcytidine (om5Cm). By sequencing the bovine liver tRNA(Leu), the structure of the anticodon was determined as f5CmAA. In addition, the nucleotide sequence showed two primary structures differing only by the nucleotide 47c which is either uridine or adenosine. The two slightly differing bovine liver tRNAs-Leu(f5CmAA) are the only tRNAs so far sequenced which contain f5Cm. The role of such a modified cytidine at the first position of the anticodon is discussed in terms of decoding properties for the UUG and UUA leucine codons. Recently, precise evidence was obtained for the presence of f5Cm at the same position in tRNAs(Leu)(NAA) isolated from rabbit and lamb liver. Therefore, the 2'-O-methyl-5-formyl modification of cytidine at position 34 could be a general feature of cytoplasmic tRNAs(Leu)(NAA) in mammals."

909,1996,3' cycle-labeled oligonucleotides with predictable length for primer extension and transgene analysis.,"Efficient labeling of short oligos at their 3'-ends was achieved through polymerase chain reaction. The length of cycled-labeled oligos can be accurately predicted by omitting one or more dNTPs in the labeling step. Thus, labeled oligos can be simply column-purified, eliminating the need for tedious gel purification. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique in determining the transcription start site of a given gene and in transgene analysis to differentiate the transcript of an endogenous gene from that of an introduced homologous gene. This technique could be widely extended to other molecular biology applications in which labeled oligos are employed."
910,1996,3' Processing and termination of mouse histone transcripts synthesized in vitro by RNA polymerase II.,"The highly expressed mouse histone H2a-614 gene is located 800 nt 5' of the histone H3-614 gene. There is a 140 nt sequence located 500 nt from the end of the H2-614 mRNA which has been defined as a transcription termination site for RNA polymerase II. We established an in vitro transcription system in which both 3' end processing and transcription termination occur. A template containing the adenovirus major late promoter, a portion of the histone H2a-614 coding region, its 3' processing signal, followed by the transcription termination site was transcribed in a nuclear extract prepared from mouse myeloma cells. Some of the transcripts synthesized in the extract were cleaved at the histone processing site in a reaction which was dependent both on the hairpin binding factor and the U7 snRNP. The efficiency of histone 3' end formation was similar both on synthetic transcripts and transcripts synthesized by RNA polymerase II. Defined transcripts, which were not processed and which mapped to the transcription termination site, were released from the template, suggesting that they were formed by transcription termination. Termination in vitro was dependent on a functional histone processing signal."
911,1996,A 1.8 kb alternative transcript from the human epidermal growth factor receptor gene encodes a truncated form of the receptor.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is encoded by the c-erbB1 proto-oncogene and plays an important role in the control of cell growth and differentiation. To study the potential growth regulatory role of soluble EGF receptors, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding a truncated, secreted form of the human EGFR. The 5' sequence of this cDNA is identical to the EGFR transcript encoding the full-length receptor through exon 10. The unique 3' sequence encodes two additional amino acid residues before encountering an in-frame stop codon, a poly(A) addition site and a poly(A)+ tail. Sequence comparison with genomic DNA sequences demonstrates that this alternative transcript arises by read-through of a splice donor site. As a result, this transcript encodes a portion of the extracellular ligand-binding domain, but lacks the transmembrane domain and the intracellular tyrosine kinase catalytic domain present in the EGFR. Conditioned medium from transfected fibroblast cells contains a 60 kDa protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by an EGFR monoclonal antibody. These findings demonstrate that alternative processing of the human EGFR transcript produces a secreted product composed of only the extracellular ligand-binding domain."
912,1996,A 39 amino acid fragment of the cell cycle regulator p21 is sufficient to bind PCNA and partially inhibit DNA replication in vivo.,"The cell cycle regulator p21 interacts with and inhibits the DNA replication and repair factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We have defined a 39 amino acid fragment of p21 which is sufficient to bind PCNA with high affinity (Kd 10-20 nM). This peptide can inhibit DNA replication in vitro and microinjection of a GST fusion protein containing this domain inhibited S phase in vivo. Despite its high affinity for PCNA, the free 39 amino acid peptide does not have a well-defined structure, as judged from circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, suggesting an induced fit mechanism for the PCNA-p21 interaction. The association of the small peptide with PCNA was thermolabile, suggesting that portions of p21 adjoining the minimal region of contact stabilize the interaction. In addition, a domain containing 67 amino acids from the N-terminus of PCNA was defined as both necessary and sufficient for binding to p21."
913,1996,A 43 kDa DNA binding protein from the pea chloroplast interacts with and stimulates the cognate DNA polymerase.,"A DNA binding protein with DNA polymerase 'accessory activity' has been identified and purified to apparent homogeneity from pea chloroplasts. This protein consists of a single subunit of 43 kDa and binds to DNA regardless of its base sequence and topology. It increases cognate DNA polymerase-primase activity in a dose dependent manner. Using solid phase protein-protein interaction trapping and co-immunoprecipitation techniques, the purified protein was found to associate with the chloroplast DNA polymerase. The chloroplast DNA polymerase also binds directly to the radioiodinated 43 kDa protein. The specific interaction between 43 kDa protein and chloroplast DNA polymerase results in the synthesis of longer DNA chains. The 43 kDa protein, present abundantly in the pea chloroplast, appears to increase processivity of the chloroplast DNA polymerase and may play an important role in the replication of pea chloroplast DNA."

Rationale and Radionuclide Scanning Evaluatlon.‰Û,"We propose a method of reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy consisting of a double Roux en Y on the same jejunal loop without interruption of the mesentery and a third anatomical Roux en Y to reconstitute the alimentary tract. The construction of the double Roux en Y draining pancreas and bile ducts separately, requires a linear Stapler 3-4 centimeters from the biliary anastomosis. In this way, by employing the same loop without mesenteric interruption, two functional excluded loops will be ‰Ûªobtained. The rationale of the suggested model is based on the separation of biliary and pancreatic secretions. This makes it possible to avoid a stagnant cul-de-sac coinciding with the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis and to obtain in the case of leakage, a pure biliary and/or pancreatic fistula as far as is possible. 99mTc HIDA scans demonstrated the efficiency, of the biliopancreatic limbs of the reconstruction, showing normal emptying time for the gastric remnant and the absence of radionuclide stagnation or any alkaline enterogastric reflux."

918,1996,A binding factor for interleukin 2 mRNA.,"Jurkat cells, a human T lymphocyte line that can be induced to synthesize and secrete interleukin 2, contain a factor that binds interleukin 2 mRNA. Binding can be demonstrated by formation of a complex detectable by gel electrophoresis. The binding is sequence specific and occurs in the 3'-non-coding region, within 160 nt of the end of the coding region, at or near a site on the mRNA that is rich in A and U residues. However, it appears not to be due to known AU binding factors. The factor is protease sensitive and binds non-covalently to interleukin 2 mRNA. It behaves like a protein of molecular weight 50 000-60 000 after UV-induced cross-linking to the mRNA. Preparations of the binding factor also protect interleukin 2 mRNA against degradation by a recently described RNasin-resistant endoribonuclease activity in Jurkat cells. Protection occurs under the same conditions required to generate the gel-retarded complex."
919,1996,A blinded comparison of fluticasone propionate with budesonide via powder devices in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a clinical evaluation,"In Vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that there are detectable differences between inhaled corticosteroids commonly used to treat asthma. However, controversy still remains as to whether these differences translate into clinical benefits. This 12-week, international, randomized, doubleblind, parallel-group study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of fluticasone propionate (FP) 800 ë_g daily, administered as a powder via the Diskhalerå¨, and budesonide (BUD) 1600 ë_g daily, administered using the Turbuhalerå¨, in adult patients with moderate-tosevere asthma. A total of 518 patients participated in the study, 256 of whom received FP and 262 BUD. Assessment of mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the 12-week treatment period revealed a statistically significant difference in efficacy between FP 800 ë_g daily and BUD 1600 ë_g daily in favour of FP (p = 0.003), with an overall improvement of 20.9 l/min with FP compared with 12.4 l/min on BUD. Statistically significant differences in favour of FP were seen over the 12 weeks for mean evening PEF (p = 0.04), diurnal PEF variation (p = 0.03) and percentage predicted PEF (p = 0.003), as well as forced expiratory volume (p = 0.008), forced vital capacity (p = 0.02) and PEF (p = 0.005) measured at clinic visits. The median percentage of symptom-free nights increased over the 12-week study period in both treatment groups, with similar changes seen for the median percentage of days with symptom score &lt; 2, rescue medication use and exacerbations of asthma. The incidence of adverse events was found to be comparable in the two treatment groups. The geometric mean ratios of serum cortisol levels were found to be 1.03 for FP, indicating no mean hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression from baseline, and 0.93 for BUD (p = 0.0002 compared with FP). In summary, FP 800 ë_g daily showed a greater efficacy/safety ratio in the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma than BUD 1600 ë_g daily."

927,1996,A CASE STUDY OF CHRONIC HEADACHES,"The following paper is a case study of a patient with a history of chronic headaches (originally diagnosed as migraine without aura) who was being treaded at the Macquarie University Chiropractic Outpatients Clinic for cervical spine dysfunction. The treatments successfully reduced the upper neck and thoracic pain that the patient was experiencing and for which they had initially presented at the clinic. During the treatments, the patient also showed a significant subjective reduction in prevalence and intensity of headaches over a four month period. Analysis of the outcome is complicated by the fact that it is not clear whether the patient‰Ûªs headaches were initially misdiagnosed as common migraine when in fact, they were cervicogenic. There may be some overlap between the two conditions, and a possible causative relationship between cervical spine dysfunction and common migraine. Furthermore, this case study discusses the validity of chiropractic treatment of organic disorders such as chronic headache or migraine."
928,1996,Accumulation of a mRNA decay intermediate by ribosomal pausing at a stop codon.,"A RNA fragment which is protected from degradation by ribosome pausing at a stop codon has been identified in growing Escherichia coli. The fragment is 261 nt long and corresponds to the 3'-end of the mRNA expressed from a semi-synthetic model gene. The 5'-end of the RNA fragment, denoted rpRNA (ribosomal pause RNA), is located 13 bases upstream of the stop codon. In vivo decay of the complete mRNA and accumulation of rpRNA are dependent on the nature of the stop codon and its codon context. The data indicate that the rpRNA fragment arises from interrupted decay of the S3A'mRNA in the 5'--&gt;m3'direction, in connection with a ribosomal pause at the stop codon. RF-2 decoding of UGA is less efficient than RF-1 decoding of UAG in identical codon contexts, as judged from rpRNA steady-state levels. The half-life of UGA-containing rpRNAs is at least 5 min, indicating that ribosomal pausing can be a major factor in stabilising downstream regions of messenger RNAs."
929,1996,A cell-free transcription system for the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus.,"We describe here the establishment of a cell-free transcription system for the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus using the cloned glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene as template. The in vitro system that operated up to a temperature of 85 degrees C initiated transcription 23 bp downstream of a TATA box located 45 bp upstream of the translational start codon of gdh mRNA, at the same site as in Pyrococcus cells. Mutational analyses revealed that this TATA box is essential for in vitro initiation of transcription. Pyrococcus transcriptional components were separated into at least two distinct transcription factor activities and RNA polymerase. One of these transcription factors could be functionally replaced by Methanococcus aTFB and Thermococcus TATA bind- ing protein (TBP). Immunochemical analyses demonstrated a structural relationship between Pyrococcus aTFB and Thermococcus TBP. These findings indicate that a TATA box and a TBP are essential components of the Pyrococcus transcriptional machinery."

These sequences define a homogeneous group of enzymes (carboxylesterases, lipases and hormone-sensitive lipases) with some related proteins devoid of enzymatic activity. The purpose of ESTHER is to help comparison and alignment of any new sequence appearing in the field, to favour mutation analysis of structure-function relationships and to allow structural data recovery. ESTHER is a World Wide Web server with the URL http://www.montpellier.inra.fr:70/cholinesterase."
931,1996,Acid binding and detritylation during oligonucleotide synthesis.,"Under the conditions normally used for detritylation in oligonucleotide synthesis, the haloacetic acid binds strongly to the oligonucleotide. Acetonitrile also forms a complex with the deblocking acid, in competition with the oligonucleotide, and drastically slows detritylation. Incomplete removal of acetonitrile during the deblock step may slow the kinetics enough to result in incomplete detritylation of the oligonucleotide. Acid binding to the growing oligonucleotide causes striking chromatographic effects in the presence of high oligonucleotide mass densities. In packed-bed column reactors, at low linear velocities, the acid binding almost completely depletes free acid from the deblocking solution. This results in an advancing zone within which the oligonucleotide is saturated with acid. Detritylation occurs mostly in a narrow band at the front of the advancing saturated zone. Increasing the DCA concentration in order to achieve quick saturation can give faster and more complete detritylation while minimizing the exposure time of the oligonucleotide to acid."
932,1996,Acid-induced exchange of the imino proton in G.C pairs.,"Acid-induced catalysis of imino proton exchange in G.C pairs of DNA duplexes is surprisingly fast, being nearly as fast as for the isolated nucleoside, despite base-pair dissociation constants in the range of 10(-5) at neutral or basic pH. It is also observed in terminal G.C pairs of duplexes and in base pairs of drug-DNA complexes. We have measured imino proton exchange in deoxyguanosine and in the duplex (ATATAGATCTATAT) as a function of pH. We show that acid-induced exchange can be assigned to proton transfer from N7-protonated guanosine to cytidine in the open state of the pair. This is faster than transfer from neutral guanosine (the process of intrinsic catalysis previously characterized at neutral ph) due to the lower imino proton pK of the protonated form, 7.2 instead of 9.4. Other interpretations are excluded by a study of exchange catalysis by formiate and cytidine as exchange catalysts. The cross-over pH between the regimes of pH-independent and acid-induced exchange rates is more basic in the case of base pairs than in the mononucleoside, suggestive of an increase by one to two decades in the dissociation constant of the base pair upon N7 protonation of G. Acid-induced catalysis is much weaker in A.T base pairs, as expected in view of the low pK for protonation of thymidine."

934,1996,A comparison of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography with Doppler sonography in the assessment of carotid arterial stenosis.,"A comparison is made of the use of selective intra-arterial subtraction angiography and doppler sonography in the assessment of disease in 206 carotid arteries. Maximal stenoses in each of the internal, external and common carotid arteries were recorded and compared using both modalities. In 93% of cases, arteries reported as normal ultrasonically were also found to be normal on angiography. However, agreement between the modalities in the assessment of severe stenoses was rather less at 79%. Overall agreement between the two modalities was good using statistical analysis (weighted Kappa). It is our view that ultrasound is reliable in normal vessels, but where significant disease is present the rate of error between the two modalities is too high to warrant omission of angiography."
935,1996,A convenient approach to the synthesis of trinucleotide phosphoramidites--synthons for the generation of oligonucleotide/peptide libraries.,"Trinucleotide phosphoramidites that correspond to the codons of all 20 amino acids were synthesized in high yield in 5g scale. Precursors of those amidites--trinucleotide phosphotriesters--have been prepared using the phosphotriester approach without protection of the 3'-hydroxyl function. The structures of trinucleotide phosphotriesters and intermediates were confirmed by 1H- and 31P-NMR spectra, mass-spectra and by analysis of SPDE-hydrolysates of deprotected preparations. Purity of the target products has been confirmed by test reactions. The synthons have been used for automated synthesis of oligonucleotides and corresponding libraries by a phosphite-triester approach. A 54mer, containing 12 randomized internal bases, and a 72mer with 24 internal randomized bases have been synthesized."
936,1996,A cost effective base-matching assay with low backgrounds.,"Base-matching or so-called mini-sequencing is a powerful technique for genotyping and mutation identification. However, its application is often hampered by high background and high cost. We have decreased the background by approximately 5-fold by incorporating an end-blocking step and using only 1/10 of the usual nucleotide concentrations."
937,1996,Activation domains of transcription factors mediate replication dependent transcription from a minimal HIV-1 promoter.,"Transcription from a minimal HIV-1 promoter containing the three Sp1 binding sites and TATA box can be activated without Tat by template DNA replication. Here we show that this activation can also be mediated by recombinant GAL4 fusion proteins containing the activation domains of Sp1, VP16 or CTF (or by full-length GAL4) targeted to the HIV-1 promoter by replacing the Sp1 sites with five GAL4 binding sites. Thus Sp1 is not unique in its ability to mediate replication activated transcription, although the degree of processivity elicited by the different activators varied significantly from strongly processive (GAL4-VP16) to relatively non-processive (GAL4-Sp1 or -CTF). Processive GAL4-VP16-activated transcription, but not efficient initiation, required multiple GAL4 binding sites. In the presence of Tat, transcription with GAL4-SP1 and GAL4-CTF was further activated (principally at the level of processivity) but GAL4-VP16-potentiated transcription was only slightly stimulated. The Tat-dependent switch from non-processive to fully processive transcription was particularly marked for GAL4-Sp1, an effect which may be relevant to the selection of Sp1 binding sites by the HIV-1 promoter."
938,1996,Acute Cholecystitis in Aged Patients,"The aim ofthis study is the analysis ofthe results in 62 patients over 70 years ofage with acute cholecystitis treated in our Department from 1970 to 1990. The clinical picture in 47 patients was mild and in 15 severe. In 14 cases (10 calculous, 4 acalculous) the acute cholecystitis subsided with antibiotics (Group A). In 48 more cases (45 calculous, 3 acalculous) following 1-3 days conservative treatment, operation was undertaken. Besides acute cholystitis there was gangrene of gallbladder in 10, choledocholithiasis in 7 and choloperitoneum without perforation in 7 cases. Cholecystostomy in 25, cholecystectomy in 15 and cholecystectomy with exploration ofthe bill duct in 8 cases was performed (Group B). There was one death in group A and 3 deaths .in group B. The hospital stay was 20 days. In conclusion the clinical findings in acute cholecystitis in the aged are usually mild. In the case of failure of medical treatment, after 2-3 days emergency surgery should be performed."
939,1996,Adhesion-independent synergy of monocytes and endothelial cells in cytokine production: regulation of IL-6 and GM‰ÛÒCSF production by PAF,"Co-Cultures of monocytes (MO) and endothelial cells (EC) were studied for their capacity to synergize in the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM‰ÛÒCSF), two cytokines potentially important in vascular physiopathology. Resting monocytes produced detectable amounts of IL-6 but no GM‰ÛÒCSF, whereas confluent EC produced significant quantities of GM‰ÛÒCSF, but minimal IL-6. In co-cultures without stimuli, additive synthesis of both cytokines was observed. When EC were pretreated, however, with either PAF, TNF or both stimuli, before addition of MO, synergistic production of IL-6 was observed. In contrast, GM‰ÛÒCSF production was not enhanced by coculture of monocytes with activated EC. When either cell population was fixed with paraformaldehyde or killed by freeze-thawing before addition to the co-culture, cytokine levels reverted to those produced by the unaffected population alone. On the other hand, separating the two cell populations by a cell-impermeable membrane in transwell cultures did not affect the synergistic production of the cytokines. Taken together, our data suggest that EC and MO can synergize in response to stimuli by producing IL-6 and that this synergy is dependent on the integrity of both cell populations, but independent of cell-cell contact."
940,1996,A Different Method of Hepaticojejunostomy for Proximal Biliary Injuries,"The management of proximal biliary injuries presents a surgical challenge. Anastomoses can be difficult to perform and can have poor results. We describe a method of hepaticojejunostomy done from within the Roux-en-Y loop, which can be utilized in this situation."
941,1996,A dominant transcriptional silencer located 5' to the human T-cell receptor V beta 2.2 gene segment which is activated in cell lines of thymic phenotype.,"We have identified a transcriptional regulatory sequence located 5' to the human T-cell receptor V beta 2.2 promoter. The upstream part of this sequence acts as a transcriptional activator in the three cell lines, Jurkat, MOLT4 and HSB2, which all have a thymic phenotype. The downstream part of the sequence exerts a dominant silencing activity in the Jurkat and MOLT4 cell lines, but not in the immature HSB2 cell line. The silencing sequence binds nuclear factor(s). Mutations of nucleotides in a short stretch of sequence, demonstrating methylation interference, abolish both the factor binding and the silencing effect. Replacement of the silencing element by a homologous sequence found 5' to the human V beta 8.1 segment, leads to a protein binding pattern which shows some DNA- protein specific complexes identical to those observed with the V beta 2.2 sequence. Interestingly, binding of nuclear factors to the V beta 2.2 silencing sequence is also observed using thymic extracts, but not using extracts from samples enriched for CD34+ cells, PBL, EBV cell lines or the HeLa cell line."

943,1996,A fluorescence-labeling method for sequencing small RNA on polyacrylamide gel.,"A practical fluorescence-labeling method for sequencing small RNAs by the traditional 'direct read out' on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was established. The 3' terminus of RNA was oxidized into dialdehyde by sodium periodate and then labeled with fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide through the condensation reaction between carbazide and aldehyde. The fluorescence-labeled RNA was partially degraded enzymatically and fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fluorescent bands were visualised by ultraviolet photography. A partial sequence of yeast 5S rRNA was determined. The result indicates that this method can be used in sequencing small RNAs rapidly, conveniently and safely."
944,1996,A functional role for some Fugu introns larger than the typical short ones: the example of the gene coding for ribosomal protein S7 and snoRNA U17.,"The compact genome of Fugu rubripes, with its very small introns, appears to be particularly suitable to study intron-encoded functions. We have analyzed the Fugu gene for ribosomal protein S7 (formerly S8, see Note), whose Xenopus homolog contains in its introns the coding sequences for the small nucleolar RNA U17. Except for intron length, the organization of the Fugu S7 gene is very similar to that of the Xenopus counterpart. The total length of the Fugu S7 gene is 3930 bp, compared with 12691 bp for Xenopus. This length difference is uniquely due to smaller introns. Although short, the six introns are longer than the approximately 100 bp size of most Fugu introns, as they host U17 RNA coding sequences. While four of the six U17 sequences are 'canonical', the remaining two represent diverged U17 pseudocopies. In fact, microinjection in Xenopus oocytes of in vitro synthesized Fugu transcripts containing the 'canonical' U17f sequence results in efficient production of mature U17 RNA, while injection of a transcript containing the U17 psi b sequence does not."
945,1996,"Afut1, a retrotransposon-like element from Aspergillus fumigatus.","A repeated DNA sequence used for epidemiological studies of the human opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus has been characterized. It is a retroelement of 6914 bp in length, bounded by long terminal repeats of 282 bp, with sequence and features characteristic of retroviruses and retrotransposons. A 5 bp duplication site was found at its borders. This element, designated Afut1, encodes amino acid sequences homologous to the reverse transcriptase, RNase H and endonuclease encoded by the pol genes of retroelements. Comparison of the peptidic sequences with other putative polypeptides of fungal LTR retrotransposons showed that Afut1 is a member of the gypsy group. This is the first report of a transposable element in A.fumigatus. Afut1 is a defective element: the putative coding domains contain multiple stop codons due exclusively to transitions from C:G to T:A."
946,1996,Age-dependent silencing of globin transgenes in the mouse.,"Variegation of transgene expression, a heterocellular or mosaic pattern of expression seen in all mice in a given transgenic line, is a frequently observed but unexplained phenomenon. We have encountered variegation with globin transgenes; when lacZ expression is driven by globin control elements a proportion of erythrocytes express beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), while the remaining erythrocytes express none. The percentage of expressing cells is constant within each line (at any particular developmental stage), but varies between lines. Such variation may account for much of the line-to-line variability which has been reported in the expression of a transgene construct. We have now extended these observations by studying expression of several globin/lacZ transgenes with increasing age. Expression of beta-gal is variegated in all lines in adult mice, including those made with a beta-globin promoter and locus control region driving lacZ. The extent of variegation differs widely between lines, but in all lines there is a marked decline in the number of erythrocytes expressing beta-gal with increasing age. Progression of silencing continues long past the point at which globin switching is complete, suggesting that it is not related to this process. We observe that age-dependent silencing is most severe in high copy number animals. Increasing variegation of transgene expression with ageing of mice is likely to complicate interpretation of the developmental regulation of transgenes. We speculate that it reflects a general mechanism of epigenetic regulation."

Each dataset consists of the changes in DNA sequence in the mutants, typically tens to hundreds, induced by mutagenesis of a particular cell line under specific conditions. The database is available on the Internet and on diskettes, and is periodically updated. Researchers are invited to submit additional data. A data entry program, MUTSIN, is available that diagrams each mutation on the computer screen as entered and alerts the user to any inconsistency between the entry and the wild type gene sequence."

949,1996,"A helicase assay based on the displacement of fluorescent, nucleic acid-binding ligands.","We have developed a new helicase assay that overcomes many limitations of other assays used to measure this activity. This continuous, kinetic assay is based on the displacement of fluorescent dyes from dsDNA upon DNA unwinding. These ligands exhibit significant fluorescence enhancement when bound to duplex nucleic acids and serve as the reporter molecules of DNA unwinding. We evaluated the potential of several dyes [acridine orange, ethidium bromide, ethidium homodimer, bis-benzimide (DAPI), Hoechst 33258 and thiazole orange] to function as suitable reporter molecules and demonstrate that the latter three dyes can be used to monitor the helicase activity of Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme. Both the binding stoichiometry of RecBCD enzyme for the ends of duplex DNA and the apparent rate of unwinding are not significantly perturbed by two of these dyes. The effects of temperature and salt concentration on the rate of unwinding were also examined. We propose that this dye displacement assay can be readily adapted for use with other DNA helicases, with RNA helicases, and with other enzymes that act on nucleic acids."

In four patients with inactive disease, concentrations of (1‰ Õ3)-ë_-D-glucan were in the normal range.The concentrations of (1‰ Õ3)-ë_-D-glucan increased in two patients, although the disease was inactive. This increase might show the earliest stage of the invasive process of the disease. In two other patients with active disease, (1‰ Õ3)-ë_-D-glucan increased. Other parameters, such as galactomannan, immunodiffusion and a radio-allergosorbent test, as well as inflammatory m arkers such as C-reactive protein and the leukocyte count, did not show any consistent tendency in regard to the activity of the disease. Thus, a (1‰ Õ3)-ë_-D-glucan assay may add valuable data for evaluating the disease activity and understanding the disease process of pulmonary aspergilloma."

956,1997,"2',5'-linked oligo-3'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphorothioate chimeras: thermal stability and antisense inhibition of gene expression.","2',5'-Linked oligo-3'-deoxyribonucleotides bind selectively to complementary RNA but not to DNA. These oligonucleotides (ODNs) do not recognize double-stranded DNA by Hoogsteen triplex formation and the complexes formed by these ODNs with RNA are not substrates for Escherichia coli RNase H. Substitution of the 2',5'-phosphodiester backbone by phosphorothioate linkages gives 2',5'-linked oligo-3'-deoxynucleoside phosphorothioate ODNs that exhibit significantly less non-specific binding to cellular proteins or thrombin. Incorporation of a stretch of seven contiguous 3',5'-linked oligo-2'-deoxynucleoside phosphorothioate linkages in the center of 2',5'-linked ODNs (as a putative RNase H recognition site) afford chimeric antisense ODNs that retain the ability to inhibit steroid 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR) expression in cell culture."
957,1997,"2'-Fluoro modified nucleic acids: polymerase-directed synthesis, properties and stability to analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.","Fragmentation is a major factor limiting mass range and resolution in the analysis of DNA by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Protonation of the nucleobase leads to base loss and backbone cleavage by a mechanism similar to the depurination reactions employed in the chemical degradation method of DNA sequencing. In a previous study [Tang,W., Zhu,L. and Smith,L.M. (1997) Anal. Chem ., 69, 302-312], the stabilizing effect of substituting the 24 hydrogen with an electronegative group such as hydroxyl or fluorine was investigated. These 24 substitutions stabilized the N-glycosidic linkage, blocking base loss and subsequent backbone cleavage. For such chemical modifications to be of practical significance, it would be useful to be able to employ the corresponding 24-modified nucleoside triphosphates in the polymerase-directed synthesis of DNA. This would provide an avenue to the preparation of 24-modified PCR fragments and dideoxy sequencing ladders stabilized for MALDI analysis. In this paper methods are described for the polymerase-directed synthesis of 24-fluoro modified DNA, using commercially available 24-fluoronucleoside triphosphates. The ability of a number of DNA and RNA polymerases to incorporate the 24-fluoro analogs was tested. Four thermostable DNA polymerases [Pfu (exo-), Vent (exo-), Deep Vent (exo-) and UlTma] were found that were able to incorporate 24-fluoronucleotides with reasonable efficiency. In order to perform Sanger sequencing reactions, the enzymes' ability to incorporate dideoxy terminators in conjunction with the 24-fluoronucleotides was evaluated. UlTma DNA polymerase was found to be the best of the enzymes tested for this purpose. MALDI analysis of enzymatically produced 24-fluoro modified DNA using the matrix 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid showed no base loss or backbone fragmentation, in contrast to the extensive fragmentation evident with unmodified DNA of the same sequence."

959,1997,3'-phosphodiesterase activity of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease at DNA double-strand break ends.,"In order to assess the possible role of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (Ape) in double-strand break repair, the substrate specificity of this enzyme was investigated using short DNA duplexes and partial duplexes, each having a single 3'-phosphoglycolate terminus. Phosphoglycolate removal by Ape was detected as a shift in mobility of 5'-end-labeled DNA strands on polyacrylamide sequencing gels, and was quantified by phosphorimaging. Recombinant Ape efficiently removed phosphoglycolates from the 3'-terminus of an internal 1 base gap in a 38mer duplex, but acted more slowly on 3'-phosphoglycolates at a 19 base-recessed 3'-terminus, at an internal nick with no missing bases, and at a double-strand break end with either blunt or 2 base-recessed 3'-termini. There was no detectable activity of Ape toward 3'-phosphoglycolates on 1 or 2 base protruding single-stranded 3'-overhangs. The results suggest that both a single-base internal gap, and duplex DNA on each side of the gap are important binding/recognition determinants for Ape. While Ape may play a role in repair of terminally blocked double-strand breaks, there must also be additional factors involved in removal of at least some damaged 3'-termini, particularly those on 3'-overhangs."

False negative and positive rates were low and the positive predictive value for malignancy was 99%. Excision biopsy for benign breast disease had decreased by almost a third during this period. Fine needle aspiration cytology is a highly accurate and cost-effective technique for the investigation of symptomatic breast lumps and results in significant savings."
962,1997,"Abasic site binding by the human apurinic endonuclease, Ape, and determination of the DNA contact sites.","The mutagenic and lethal effects of abasic sites in DNA are averted by repair initiated by 'class II' apurinic (AP) endonucleases, which cleave immediately 5'to abasic sites. We examined substrate binding by the human AP endonuclease, Ape protein (also called Hap1, Apex or Ref-1). In electrophoretic mobility-shift experiments, Ape bound synthetic DNA substrates containing single AP sites or tetrahydrofuran (F) residues. No complexes were detected with single-stranded substrates or unmodified duplex DNA. In EDTA, the concentration of Ape required to shift 50% of duplex F-DNA was approximately 50 nM, while the addition of 10 mM MgCl2 nearly eliminated detectable F-DNA@Ape complexes. Filter-binding studies demonstrated a half-life of approximately 50 s at 0 degrees C for F-DNA@Ape complexes in the presence of EDTA, and &lt;15 s after the addition of Mg2+. The DNA recovered from F-DNA@Ape complexes was intact but was rapidly cleaved upon addition of Mg2+, which suggests that these protein-DNA complexes are on the catalytic pathway for incision. Methylation and ethylation interference experiments identified DNA contacts critical for Ape binding, and Cu-1, 10-phenanthroline footprinting suggested an Ape-induced structural distortion at the abasic site prior to cleavage."
963,1997,Abdominal Wall Sinus: A Late Complication of Gallstone Spillage During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy,"Long term complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are uncommon. However, as experience with this procedure accumulates, sporadic reports of non-biliary complication have been published. We report a case of abdominal wall sinus formation secondary to gallbladder perforation and stone spillage occurring during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
964,1997,A behavior-genetic approach to multiple chemical sensitivity.,"This report emphasizes the application of behavior-genetic designs to the study of sensitivity to toxic chemicals, and features of multiple chemical sensitivity and substance abuse that are polar opposites. The implications of these issues for future research are discussed in relation to twin, adoption, and sibling pair studies, as well as in relation to the degree to which genetically selected lines of rodents that have been developed in the alcoholism field are applicable to multiple chemical sensitivity."
965,1997,A biologically active 53 kDa fragment of overproduced alanyl-tRNA synthetase from Thermus thermophilus HB8 specifically interacts with tRNA Ala acceptor helix.,"The alaS gene encoding the alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) from Thermus thermophilus HB8 was cloned and sequenced. The gene comprises 2646 bp, corresponding to 882 amino acids, 45% of which are identical to the enzyme from Escherichia coli . The T. thermophilus AlaRS was overproduced in E.coli , purified and characterized. It has high thermal stability up to approximately 65 degrees C, with a temperature optimum of aminoacylation activity at approximately 60 degrees C, and will be valuable for crystallization. The purified enzyme appears as a dimer with a specific activity of 220 U/mg and k cat/ K M values of 118 000/s/M for alanine and 114 000/s/M for ATP. By genetic engineering a 53 kDa fragment of AlaRS comprising the N-terminal 470 amino acids (AlaN470) was also overproduced and purified. It is as stable as entire AlaRS and sufficient for specific aminoacylation of intact tRNAAla, as well as acceptor stem microhelices with a G3-U70, but not U3-A70, I3-U70 or C3-U70, base pair. The reduced binding strength of such microhelices to AlaN470 enabled, due to the resulting fast exchange of the microhelices between free and complexed states, preliminary NMR analyses of the binding mode and intermolecular recognition."
966,1997,A-bomb data: detection of bias in the Life Span Study cohort.,"By drawing a distinction between A-bomb survivors with and without bomb-related injuries, it was possible to see that instead of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort being a normal, homogenous population, there were significant differences between survivors with and without multiple injuries, and that these differences occurred largely among survivors who were under 10 or over 50 years of age when exposed. There also was a concentration of A-bomb-related injuries among survivors who eventually developed leukemia. So it is possible that deaths before 1950 had left the LSS cohort permanently biased in favor of persons who had high levels of resistance to all (early and late) effects of radiation. It is also possible that the high proportion of leukemia cases among the deaths of A-bomb survivors from 1950 to 1970 were because the radiation caused an initial leukocytosis followed by loss of immunologic competence."
967,1997,A branched DNA signal amplification assay for quantification of nucleic acid targets below 100 molecules/ml.,"The branched DNA hybridization assay has been improved by the inclusion of the novel nucleotides, isoC and isoG, in the amplification sequences to prevent non-specific hybridization. The novel isoC, isoG-containing amplification sequences have no detectable interaction with any natural DNA sequence. The control of non-specific hybridization in turn permits increased signal amplification. Addition of a 14 site preamplifier was found to increase the signal/noise ratio 8-fold. A set of 74 oligonucleotide probes was designed to the consensus HIV POL sequence. The detection limit of this new HIV branched DNA amplifier assay was approximately 50 molecules/ml. The assay was used to measure viral load in 87 plasma samples of HIV- infected patients on triple drug therapy whose RNA titers were &lt;500 molecules/ml. In all 11 patients viral load eventually declined to below the detection limit with the new assay."
968,1997,A branch point consensus from Arabidopsis found by non-circular analysis allows for better prediction of acceptor sites.,"Little knowledge exists about branch points in plants; it has even been claimed that plant introns lack conserved branch point sequences similar to those found in vertebrate introns. A putative branch point consensus sequence for Arabidopsis thaliana resembling the well known metazoan consensus sequence has been proposed, but this is based on search of sequences similar to those in yeast and metazoa. Here we present a novel consensus sequence found by a non-circular approach. A hidden Markov model with a fixed A nucleotide was trained on sequences upstream of the acceptor site. The consensus found by the Markov model shares features with the metazoan consensus, but differs in its details from the consensus proposed earlier. Despite the fact that branch point consensus sequences in plants are weak, we show that a prediction scheme incorporating them leads to a substantial improvement in the recognition of true acceptor sites; the false positive rate being reduced by a factor of 2. We take this as an indication that the consensus found here is the genuine one and that the branch point does play a role in the proper recognition of the acceptor site in plants."

Average frequency of episodes was reduced on average by 90%, duration of each episode by 38%, and use of medication was reduced by 94%. In addition, several associated symptoms were substantially reduced, including nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia.Discussion: The various cases are presented to assist practitioners making a more informed prognosis."
975,1997,ACCELERATIONS RECORDED FROM THE SPINOUS PROCESSES DURING SPINAL MANIPULATIVE TREATMENTS OF THE THORACIC SPINE,"The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency components of accelerations measured on the spinous processes of vertebrae caused by chiropractic treatments, and to speculate as to the origin of the various components. We found distinct acceleration signals in the range of 0-50 Hz and above 200 Hz. The low frequency components were convincingly matched to the displacements caused by the manipulative forces; the high frequency components were found to be similar in duration and shape to confirmed cavitations in synovial joints, thus they were speculated to originate from the spinal facet joints."
976,1997,Accumulated body burden and endogenous release of lead in employees of a lead smelter.,"Bone lead levels for 367 active and 14 retired lead smelter workers were measured in vivo by X-ray fluorescence in May-June 1994. The bone sites of study were the tibia and calcaneus; magnitudes of concentration were used to gauge lead body burden. Whole blood lead readings from the workers generated a cumulative blood lead index (CBLI) that approximated the level of lead exposure over time. Blood lead values for 204 of the 381 workers were gathered from workers returning from a 10-month work interruption that ended in 1991; their blood level values were compared to their tibia and calcaneus lead levels. The resulting relations allowed constraints to be placed on the endogenous release of lead from bone in smelter works. Calcaneus lead levels were found to correlate strongly with those for tibia lead, and in a manner consistent with observations from other lead industry workers. Relations between bone lead concentration and CBLI demonstrated a distinctly nonlinear appearance. When the active population was divided by date of hire, a significant difference in the bone lead-CBLI slope emerged. After a correction to include the component of CBLI existing before the workers' employment at the smelter was made, this difference persisted. This implies that the transfer of lead from blood to bone in the workers has changed over time, possibly as a consequence of varying exposure conditions.ImagesFigure 1. AFigure 1. BFigure 2.

977,1997,Acetylation as an indicator of risk.,"Aromatic amine acetylation has been recognized for many years as an important metabolic polymorphism in humans because of its relationship to disease. This system serves as a model in risk assessment because of its role in drug and carcinogen activation and detoxification and because of the case with which it is measured. However, possible interactions of NAT1-NAT2 phenotypes or genotypes illustrate the complexity of xenobiotic metabolism pathways. Moreover, the use of such information for risk assessment is further complicated by the association of the rapid phenotype with increased risk in colon cancer and the slow phenotype with increased risk in urinary bladder cancer. Before this biomarker can be effectively utilized as a significant predictor of individual risk, it will be necessary to identify specific sources of aromatic amine exposure and to characterize further the substrate specificity of NAT1 and NAT2 in relation to the multiplicity of enzyme variants occurring in human populations."
978,1997,A closed tube format for amplification and detection of DNA based on energy transfer.,"A new method for the direct detection of PCR-amplified DNA in a closed system is described. The method is based on the incorporation of energy transfer-labeled primers into the amplification product. The PCR primers contain hairpin structures on their 5'ends with donor and acceptor moieties located in close proximity on the hairpin stem. The primers are designed in such a way that a fluorescent signal is generated only when the primers are incorporated into an amplification product. A signal to background ratio of 35:1 was obtained using the hairpin primers labeled with fluorescein as a donor and 4-(4'-dimethylaminophenylazo) benzoic acid (DABCYL) as a quencher. The modified hairpin-primers do not interfere with the activity of DNA polymerase, and both thermostable Pfu and Taq polymerase can be used. This method was applied to the detection of cDNA for prostate specific antigen. The results demonstrate that the fluorescent intensity of the amplified product correlates with the amount of incorporated primers, and as few as 10 molecules of the initial template can be detected. This technology eliminates the risk of carry-over contamination, simplifies the amplification assay and opens up new possibilities for the real-time quantification of the amplified DNA over an extremely wide dynamic range."
979,1997,A coalescent approach to the polymerase chain reaction.,"A versatile algorithm is developed to model PCR on a computer. The method is based on a modification of the coalescent process and provides a general framework to analyse data from PCR. It allows for incorporation of the dynamics of the replication process as described in terms of the number of starting template molecules and cycle-dependent PCR efficiency. The simulation method generates, as a first step, the genealogy of a set of sequences sampled from a final PCR product. In a second step a mutation process is superimposed and the resulting data set is analysed. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to get reliable approximations of various sample distributions. We demonstrate the relevance of our method with two applications: maximum likelihood estimation of the error rate in PCR and a test of homogeneity of the template."
980,1997,A common RNA structural motif involved in the internal initiation of translation of cellular mRNAs.,"The 5'-non-translated regions (5'NTR) of human immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), Antennapedia (Antp) ofDrosophilaand human fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) mRNAs are reported to mediate translation initiation by an internal ribosome binding mechanism. In this study, we investigate predicted features of the higher order structures folded in these 5'NTR sequences. Statistical analyses of RNA folding detected a 92 nt unusual folding region (UFR) from 129 to 220, close to the initiator AUG in the BiP mRNA. Details of the structural analyses show that the UFR forms a Y-type stem-loop structure with an additional stem-loop in the 3'-end resembling the common structure core found in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements of picornavirus. The Y-type structural motif is also conserved among a number of divergent BiP mRNAs. We also find two RNA elements in the 5'-leader sequence of human FGF-2. The first RNA element (96 nt) is 2 nt upstream of the first CUG start codon located in the reported IRES element of human FGF-2. The second (107 nt) is immediately upstream of the authentic initiator AUG of the main open reading frame. Intriguingly, the folded RNA structural motif in the two RNA elements is conserved in other members of FGF family and shares the same structural features as that found in the 5'NTR of divergent BiP mRNAs. We suggest that the common RNA structural motif conserved in the diverse BiP and FGF-2 mRNAs has a general function in the internal ribosome binding mechanism of cellular mRNAs."
981,1997,"A Comparative Analysis of the Murine Thymic Microenvironment in Normal, Autoimmune, and Immunodeficiency States","It is widely accepted that the thymic microenvironment regulates normal thymopoiesis through a highly coordinated and complex series of cellular and cytokine interactions. A direct corollary of this is that abnormalities within the microenvironment could be of etiologic significance in T-cell-based diseases. Our laboratory has developed a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that react specifically with epithelial or nonepithelial markers in the thymus. We have taken advantage of these reagents to characterize the thymic microenvironment of several genetic strains of mice, including BALB/cJ, C57BL/6J, NZB/BlnJ, SM/J, NOD/Ltz, NOD/Ltz-scid/sz, C57BL/6J-Hcph me/Hcph me, and ALY/NscJcl-aly/aly mice, and littermate control animals. We report herein that control mice, including strains of several backgrounds, have a very consistent phenotypic profile with this panel of monoclonal antibodies, including reactivity with thymic epithelial cells in the cortex, the medulla and the corticomedullary junction, and the extracellular matrix. In contrast, the disease-prone strains studied have unique, abnormal staining of thymic cortex and medulla at both the structural and cellular levels. These phenotypic data suggest that abnormalities in interactions between developing thymocytes and stromal cells characterize disease-prone mice."
982,1997,A comparison of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to human genomic sequences.,"The Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) division of GenBank, dbEST, is a large repository of the data being generated by human genome sequencing centers. ESTs are short, single pass cDNA sequences generated from randomly selected library clones. The approximately 415 000 human ESTs represent a valuable, low priced, and easily accessible biological reagent. As many ESTs are derived from yet uncharacterized genes, dbEST is a prime starting point for the identification of novel mRNAs. Conversely, other genes are represented by hundreds of ESTs, a redundancy which may provide data about rare mRNA isoforms. Here we present an analysis of &gt;1000 ESTs generated by the WashU-Merck EST project. These ESTs were collected by querying dbEST with the genomic sequences of 15 human genes. When we aligned the matching ESTs to the genomic sequences, we found that in one gene, 73% of the ESTs which derive from spliced or partially spliced transcripts either contain intron sequences or are spliced at previously unreported sites; other genes have lower percentages of such ESTs, and some have none. This finding suggests that ESTs could provide researchers with novel information about alternative splicing in certain genes. In a related analysis of pairs of ESTs which are reported to derive from a single gene, we found that as many as 26% of the pairs do not BOTH align with the sequence of the same gene. We suspect that some of these unusual ESTs result from artifacts in EST generation, and caution researchers that they may find such clones while analyzing sequences in dbEST."
983,1997,A comparison of volume control and pressure-regulated volume control ventilation in acute respiratory failure,"Background:The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a new mode of ventilation (pressure-regulated volume control; PRVC) is associated with improvements in respiratory mechanics and outcome when compared with conventional volume control (VC) ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure. We conducted a randomised, prospective, open, cross over trial on 44 patients with acute respiratory failure in the general intensive care unit of a university hospital. After a stabilization period of 8 h, a cross over trial of 2 ÌÑ 2 h was conducted. Apart from the PRVC/VC mode, ventilator settings were comparable. The following parameters were recorded for each patient: days on ventilator, failure in the assigned mode of ventilation (peak inspiratory pressure &gt; 50 cmH2O) and survival.Results:In the crossover trial, peak inspiratory pressure was significantly lower using PRVC than with VC (20 cmH2O vs 24 cmH2O, P &lt; 0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were found.Conclusions:Peak inspiratory pressure was significantly lower during PRVC ventilation than during VC ventilation, and thus PRVC may be superior to VC in certain patients. However, in this small group of patients, we could not demonstrate that PRVC improved outcome."
984,1997,A competitive enzyme hybridization assay for plasma determination of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides.,"An enzyme competitive hybridization assay was developed and validated for determination of mouse plasma concentrations of a 15mer antisense phosphodiester oligodeoxyribonucleotide and of two phosphorothioate analogs. Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. The phosphodiester sense sequence was covalently bound to the microwells. The 5'-biotinylated antisense sequence was used as tracer. The principle of the assay involves competitive hybridization of tracer and antisense nucleotide to the solid phase-immobilized sense oligonucleotide. Solid phase- bound tracer oligonucleotide was assayed after reaction with a streptavidin-acetylcholinesterase conjugate, using the colorimetric method of Ellman. As in competitive enzyme immunoassays, coloration was inversely related to the amount of analyte initially present in the sample. The limit of quantification was 900 pM for phosphodiester antisense oligonucleotide using a 100 microl volume of plasma without extraction. Cross-reactivity was negligible after a four base deletion in either the 3'or 5'position. The assay was simple and sensitive, suitable for in vitro screening of oligonucleotide hybridization potency in biological fluids and for measuring the plasma pharmacokinetics of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester sequences."
985,1997,A complex of RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins persists on DNA after single-strand cleavage at V(D)J recombination signal sequences.,"The recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and 2 proteins are required for initiation of V(D)J recombination in vivo and have been shown to be sufficient to introduce DNA double-strand breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in a cell-free assay in vitro. RSSs consist of a highly conserved palindromic heptamer that is separated from a slightly less conserved A/T-rich nonamer by either a 12 or 23 bp spacer of random sequence. Despite the high sequence specificity of RAG-mediated cleavage at RSSs, direct binding of the RAG proteins to these sequences has been difficult to demonstrate by standard methods. Even when this can be demonstrated, questions about the order of events for an individual RAG-RSS complex will require methods that monitor aspects of the complex during transitions from one step of the reaction to the next. Here we have used template-independent DNA polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in order to assess occupancy of the reaction intermediates by the RAG complex during the reaction. In addition, this approach allows analysis of the accessibility of end products of a RAG-catalyzed cleavage reaction for N nucleotide addition. The results indicate that RAG proteins form a long-lived complex with the RSS once the initial nick is generated, because the 3'-OH group at the nick remains obstructed for TdT-catalyzed N nucleotide addition. In contrast, the 3'-OH group generated at the signal end after completion of the cleavage reaction can be efficiently tailed by TdT, suggesting that the RAG proteins disassemble from the signal end after DNA double-strand cleavage has been completed. Therefore, a single RAG complex maintains occupancy from the first step (nick formation) to the second step (cleavage). In addition, the results suggest that N region diversity at V(D)J junctions within rearranged immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene loci can only be introduced after the generation of RAG-catalyzed DNA double-strand breaks, i.e. during the DNA end joining phase of the V(D)J recombination reaction."
986,1997,A computational genomics approach to the identification of gene networks.,"To delineate the astronomical number of possible interactions of all genes in a genome is a task for which conventional experimental techniques are ill-suited. Sorely needed are rapid and inexpensive methods that identify candidates for interacting genes, candidates that can be further investigated by experiment. Such a method is introduced here for an important class of gene interactions, i.e., transcriptional regulation via transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific enhancer or silencer sites. The method addresses the question: which of the genes in a genome are likely to be regulated by one or more TFs with known DNA binding specificity? It takes advantage of the fact that many TFs show cooperativity in transcriptional activation which manifests itself in closely spaced TF binding sites. Such 'clusters' of binding sites are very unlikely to occur by chance alone, as opposed to individual sites, which are often abundant in the genome. Here, statistical information about binding site clusters in the genome, is complemented by information about (i) known biochemical functions of the TF, (ii) the structure of its binding site, and (iii) function of the genes near the cluster, to identify genes likely to be regulated by a given transcription factor. Several applications are illustrated with the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and four different DNA binding activities, SBF, MBF, a sub-class of bHLH proteins and NBF. The technique may aid in the discovery of interactions between genes of known function, and the assignment of biological functions to putative open reading frames."
987,1997,A conserved core element is functionally important for maize mitochondrial promoter activity in vitro.,"We have previously used a homologous in vitro transcription system to define functional elements of the maize mitochondrial atpA promoter. These elements comprise a central domain extending from -7 to +5, relative to the transcription start site, and an upstream domain of 1-3 bp that is purine rich and centered around positions -11 to -12. Within the central domain lies an essential 5 bp core element. These elements are conserved in many mitochondrial promoters, but their functionality has only been tested for atpA. In this study we have introduced mutations into the corresponding elements of two cox3 promoters and show that while the core element is essential for cox3 promoter activity, upstream element mutations have little or no effect. To define the minimal sequence required for in vitro promoter activity a series of short cloned oligonucleotides corresponding to the atpA promoter was used. While some activity was seen with a 14 bp sequence, full activity required 26 bp, suggesting that elements other than the core and upstream region can influence promoter strength. Another series of clones showed that altered spacing between the upstream and core elements of atpA had a significant effect on promoter activity. These results further define important features of the plant mitochondrial transcriptional machinery."
988,1997,A cruciform-dumbbell model for inverted dimer formation mediated by inverted repeats.,"Small inverted repeats (small palindromes) on plasmids have been shown to mediate a recombinational rearrangement event in Escherichia coli leading to the formation of inverted dimers (giant palindromes). This recombinational rearrangement event is efficient and independent of RecA and RecBCD. In this report, we propose a cruciform-dumbbell model to explain the inverted dimer formation mediated by inverted repeats. In this model, the inverted repeats promote the formation of a DNA cruciform which is processed by an endonuclease into a linear DNA with two hairpin loops at its ends. Upon DNA replication, this linear dumbbell-like DNA is then converted to the inverted dimer. In support of this model, linear dumbbell DNA molecules with unidirectional origin of DNA replication (ColE1 ori ) have been constructed and shown to transform E.coli efficiently resulting in the formation of the inverted dimer. The ability of linear dumbbell DNA to transform E.coli suggests that the terminal loops may be important in bypassing the requirement of DNA supercoiling for initiation of replication of the ColE1 ori."
989,1997,Action of chronic irradiation on the cytogenetic damage of human lymphocyte culture.,"The action of chronic irradiation (dose rate 2.9 Gy/day) on human lymphocyte culture was investigated. Whole blood was irradiated at 37 degrees C. Aliquots (0.2 ml) of whole blood were cultivated by the standard method. A medium containing phytohemagglutinin was added immediately after irradiation. All structural chromosome- and chromatid-type changes were recorded. The experimental data showed that the conditions of irradiation of lymphocytes affected neither the background level of chromosome damage nor their radiosensitivity. The obtained dose-response curve of chromosome aberrations was described by a linear regression, which then became a plateau. There is no statistically significant difference between the results for the low doses (10-50 cGy) of chronic and acute radiation."
990,1997,Activated levels of rRNA synthesis in fission yeast are driven by an intergenic rDNA region positioned over 2500 nucleotides upstream of the initiation site.,"RNA polymerase I-catalyzed synthesis of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe approximately 37S pre-rRNAs was shown to be sensitive to regulatory sequences located several kilobases upstream of the initiation site for the rRNA gene. An in vitro transcription system for RNA polymerase I-catalyzed RNA synthesis was established that supports correct and activated transcription from templates bearing a full S. pombe rRNA gene promoter. A 780 bp region starting at -2560 significantly stimulates transcription of ac is-located rDNA promoter and competes with an rDNA promoter in trans, thus displaying some of the activities of rDNA transcriptional enhancers in vitro. Deletion of a 30 bp enhancer-homologous domain in this 780 bp far upstream region blocked its cis-stimulatory effect. The sequence of the S. pombe 3.5 kb intergenic spacer was determined and its organization differs from that of vertebrate, Drosophila, Acanthamoeba and plant intergenic rDNA spacers: it does not contain multiple, imperfect copies of the rRNA gene promoter nor repetitive elements of 140 bp, as are found in vertebrate rDNA enhancers."
991,1997,Activation of enhancer elements by the homeobox gene Cdx2 is cell line specific.,"Cdx2 is a caudal-related homeodomain transcription factor that is expressed in complex patterns during mouse development and at high levels in the intestinal epithelium of adult mice. Cdx2 activates transcription of intestinal gene promoters containing specific binding sites. Moreover, Cdx2 has been shown to induce intestinal differentiation in cell lines. In this study, we show that Cdx2 is able to bind to two well defined enhancer elements in the HoxC8 gene. We then demonstrate that Cdx2 is able to activate transcription of heterologous promoters when its DNA binding element is placed in an enhancer context. Furthermore, the ability to activate enhancer elements is cell-line dependent. When the Cdx2 activation domain was linked to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, the chimeric protein was able to activate Gal4 enhancer constructs in an intestinal cell line, but was unable to activate transcription in NIH3T3 cells. These data suggest that there are cell-specific factors that allow the Cdx2 activation domain to function in the activation of enhancer elements. We hypothesize that either a co-activator protein or differential phosphorylation of the activation domain may be the mechanism for intestinal cell line-specific function of Cdx2 and possibly in other tissues in early development."
992,1997,Activities of an Environmental Analysis Van in the German Federal State Schleswig-Holstein.,"A cooperation was started between the Union of Physicians of Schleswig-Holstein (Bad Segeberg, Germany) and an environmental engineer in 1992. A mobile unit for environmental analysis was set up, the Environmental analysis Van (EAV) or mobile umweltambulanz. Inspection of sites and collection of air and dust/material samples for analysis of xenobiotics were performed on request. The results of this cooperation were evaluated to show which sources of indoor pollutants could be particularly relevant to human health impairment. During a 30-month period form July 1993 to December 1995, 1793 site inspections wer conducted. Xenobiotic analysis and subsequent advising was performed in 1318 cases; enhanced concentrations of one or more toxic substances (mainly biocides such a pentachlorophenol, permethrin, and/or hexachlorocyclohexane) were found in 71% of the sites analyzed. Formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, and contamination by molds were also documented. A follow-up was done on 80 clients of the Environmental Analysis Van, which had detected elevated concentrations of permethrin because of pyrethroid-treated carpeting. The effect of removing all contaminated carpeting on health improvement in comparison with nonremoval was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). Pyrethroid-treated carpeting, which was already 5, 7 and 10 years old, revealed permethrin concentrations of 115, 100, and 150 mg/kg dust. This result indicates that indoor contamination of permethrin is highly persistent and may be the cause of adverse health effects.ImagesFigure 1.Figure 2.Figure 3."
993,1997,Adaptor-tagged competitive PCR: a novel method for measuring relative gene expression.,"A simple and reliable PCR-based method to quantitate gene expression is described. Following the digestion of double-stranded cDNA by a restriction enzyme, an adaptor is ligated to a cDNA from a first RNA sample, and another adaptor to a second RNA sample. The two adaptors share a common sequence at the outer region, but differ in size. Equal amounts of the ligated samples are mixed, and amplified by an adaptor-primer and a primer specific to the gene of interest. Products derived from the two sources differ in size, and can be separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ratio of the two products reveals the relative level of gene expression. Since the technique avoids the need to construct internal standards, it is especially useful for the analysis of many different gene transcripts."
994,1997,Additional thyroid dose factor from transportation sources in Russia after the Chernobyl disaster.,"Beginning approximately 4 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident a steady increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer was observed in children and adolescents of the Bryansk Oblast, which received the highest level of radionuclide contaminants in Russia. We examined the spatial relationship between the residence location of patients with identified thyroid cancer (0-18 years old at the time of the accident) and a number of geographic parameters to better account for the etiology of thyroid cancer spatial distribution. Geographic parameters analyzed included spatial distribution of 137Cs and 131I in soil, population demographics, measurements and reconstructions. of absorbed thyroid 131I doses in the population, and maps of major transportation arteries. An interesting finding is the lack of a consistent correlation between the spatial distribution of radionuclides in the soil and thyroid cancer incidence. Instead, most of the thyroid cancer cases were diagnosed in settlements situated on major railways and roads. Correlating population with thyroid cancer cases and transportation arteries reveals a much higher cancer rate on or near major roads and railways than at a distance from them, again independent of radionuclide soil concentration. There are other important factors, of course, that must be considered in future evaluations of this phenomenon. These include the influence of iodine endemic zones, genetic predisposition to thyroid cancer, and duration of residence time in contaminated areas. The feasibility of radionuclide transport on railways and roads is discussed, together with the vectors for transfer of the contaminants to the human population. Developing a model to reconstruct the radiation dose to the thyroid over time in this geographic region is proposed in light of the impact of transportation arteries. Specific studies are outlined to provide the data necessary to develop this model as well as to better characterize the feasibility and scientific validity of the contribution to human health effects of this transport factor. Transport factor refers to the transport of radionuclides on transportation arteries and the transfer of these agents to the human population residing in the vicinity of these arteries. If the impact on thyroid cancer of the transport of radionuclides on major railways and roads is indeed significant, a major reappraisal of the risk of large-scale radioactive release into the environment is necessary."

It is suggested that this lipophilic region affects binding to specific receptors and may, in fact, differentiate harmful from beneficial estrogens.ImagesFigure 1."
999,1997,A dicistronic construct allows easy detection of human CFTR expression from YAC DNA in human cells.,"We have made a dicistronic construct where the picornaviral internal ribosome-entry site (IRES) driving the expression of the beta-geo gene has been inserted into the 3'untranslated region of the human CFTR gene present in a YAC. When introduced into the human cell line Caco-2 expressing the CFTR gene, the expression of the dicistronic gene can be detected by lacZ staining and follows the accumulation of the endogenous CFTR mRNA upon differentiation of the cells. These data demonstrate that this IRES-based approach presents an alternative to mRNA in situ hybridisation and allows detection of expression in an autologous system."
1000,1997,Adjacent GATA and kappa B-like motifs regulate the expression of a Drosophila immune gene.,"The GATA motif is a well known positive cis -regulatory element in vertebrates. In this work we report experimental evidence for the direct participation of a GATA motif in the expression of the Drosophila antibacterial peptide gene Cecropin A1 . Previously we have shown that a kappaB-like site is necessary for Cecropin A1 gene expression. Here we present evidence that the Drosophila Rel protein which binds to the kappaB-like site requires an intact GATA site for maximal Dif-mediated transactivation of the Cecropin A1 gene. We show that a Drosophila blood cell line contains factors binding specifically to the GATA motif of the Cecropin A1 gene. The GATA binding activity is likely to include member(s) of the GATA family of transcriptional regulators. We show that the promoters of several inducible insect immune genes possess GATA sites 0-12 base pairs away from kappaB-like sites in functionally important promoter regions. Clusters of GATA and kappaB sites are also observed in the promoters of two important mammalian immune genes, namely IL6 and IL3. The consistent proximity of GATA and kappaB sites appears to be a common theme in the immune gene expression of insects and mammals."
1001,1998,13th meeting of the Scientific Group on Methodologies for the Safety Evaluation of Chemicals (SGOMSEC): alternative testing methodologies and conceptual issues.,"Substantial world-wide resources are being committed to develop improved toxicological testing methods that will contribute to better protection of human health and the environment. The development of new methods is intrinsically driven by new knowledge emanating from fundamental research in toxicology, carcinogenesis, molecular biology, biochemistry, computer sciences, and a host of other disciplines. Critical evaluations and strong scientific consensus are essential to facilitate adoption of alternative methods for use in the safety assessment of drugs, chemicals, and other environmental factors. Recommendations to hasten the development of new alternative methods included increasing emphasis on the development of mechanism-based methods, increasing fundamental toxicological research, increasing training on the use of alternative methods, integrating accepted alternative methods into toxicity assessment, internationally harmonizating chemical toxicity classification schemes, and increasing international cooperation to develop, validate, and gain acceptance of alternative methods."
1002,1998,13th Meeting of the Scientific Group on Methodologies for the Safety Evaluation of Chemicals (SGOMSEC): alternative testing methodologies for ecotoxicity.,"There is growing public pressure to minimize the use of vertebrates in ecotoxicity testing; therefore, effective alternatives to toxicity tests causing suffering are being sought. This report discusses alternatives and differs in some respects from the reports of the other three groups because the primary concern is with harmful effects of chemicals at the level of population and above rather than with harmful effects upon individuals. It is concluded that progress toward the objective of minimizing testing that causes suffering would be served by the following initiatives--a clearer definition of goals and strategies when undertaking testing procedures; development of alternative assays, including in vitro test systems, that are based on new technology; development of nondestructive assays for vertebrates (e.g., biomarkers) that do not cause suffering; selection of most appropriate species, strains, and developmental stages for testing procedures (but no additional species for basic testing); better integrated and more flexible testing procedures incorporating biomarker responses, ecophysiological concepts, and ecological end points (progress in this direction depends upon expert judgment). In general, testing procedures could be made more realistic, taking into account problems with mixtures, and with volatile or insoluble chemicals."
1003,1998,13th Meeting of the Scientific Group on Methodologies for the Safety Evaluation of Chemicals (SGOMSEC): alternative testing methodologies for organ toxicity.,"In the past decade in vitro tests have been developed that represent a range of anatomic structure from perfused whole organs to subcellular fractions. To assess the use of in vitro tests for toxicity testing, we describe and evaluate the current status of organotypic cultures for the major target organs of toxic agents. This includes liver, kidney, neural tissue, the hematopoietic system, the immune system, reproductive organs, and the endocrine system. The second part of this report reviews the application of in vitro culture systems to organ specific toxicity and evaluates the application of these systems both in industry for safety assessment and in government for regulatory purposes. Members of the working group (WG) felt that access to high-quality human material is essential for better use of in vitro organ and tissue cultures in the risk assessment process. Therefore, research should focus on improving culture techniques that will allow better preservation of human material. The WG felt that it is also important to develop and make available relevant reference compounds for toxicity assessment in each organ system, to organize and make available via the Internet complete in vivo toxicity data, including human data, containing dose, end points, and toxicokinetics. The WG also recommended that research should be supported to identify and to validate biological end points for target organ toxicity to be used in alternative toxicity testing strategies."
1004,1998,13th Meeting of the Scientific Group on Methodologies for the Safety Evaluation of Chemicals (SGOMSEC): validation and acute toxicity testing.,"Scientific principles demand that before newly developed alternative methods for safety testing are fully embraced by the industrial or regulatory community, they reliably and reproducibly predict the designated toxic end point. The process used to determine reliability and reproducibility is termed validation, and it generally culminates with a highly controlled, blinded study using multiple chemicals and laboratories. It is imperative that the validation study is designed to confirm the previously established reproducibility and predictive power of the assay. Much has been learned recently about the practical aspects of validation through investigation of alternative methods for acute toxicity testing, i.e., those methods that assess acute systemic toxicity, skin irritation, and eye irritation. Although considerable progress has been made--many alternative tests are now commonly used in various industrial settings--there have been few tests that have successfully passed a complete validation. Some of the barriers to successful validation have been a) lack of high-quality, reproducible animal data; b) insufficient knowledge of the fundamental biologic processes involved in acute toxicity; and c) the development of truly robust in vitro assays that can accurately respond to materials with a wide range of chemical and physical characteristics. It is recommended that to progress in the areas of eye and skin irritation we need to expand our knowledge of toxic markers in humans and the biochemical basis of irritation; progress in the area of acute systemic toxicity will require the development of in vitro models to determine gastrointestinal uptake, blood-brain barrier passage, and biotransformation.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2"
1005,1998,"(1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)iron (III)-mediated cleavage of DNA: detection of selected protein-DNA interactions.","A new reagent for the oxidative cleavage of DNA, (1,4,7-trimethyl-1, 4,7-triazacyclononane)iron(III) chloride was recently introduced. We have determined the utility of this reagent for detecting protein-DNA interactions within two types of complexes. Interestingly, we find that the rates of DNA cleavage by this reagent are differentially affected by the two classes of protein-DNA interactons studied. We find that the rate of DNA cleavage by this reagent is relatively unaffected by the non-sequence-specific histone-DNA interactions within a nucleosome complex. Conversely, a clear footprint pattern is obtained with two different DNA sequence-specific protein-DNA complexes. The results suggest that (1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)iron(III) chloride will be a useful reagent to probe trans -acting-factor-DNA interactions within a chromatin environment. Differences between these two types of protein-DNA interactions, which might account for this observation, are discussed."
1006,1998,15N investigation into the effect of a pollutant on the nitrogen metabolism of Tetrahymena pyriformis as a model for environmental medical research.,"A pilot study was performed to examine the potential of stable isotope techniques for monitoring the impact of a harmful substance on the cellular nitrogen metabolism in the ciliate species Tetrahymena pyriformis. After identical cultivation periods of control cells and toluene-exposed cells in a defined culture medium enriched with [guanidino-15N2]l-arginine, a number of nitrogen-containing pools were analyzed: 1) quantity and 15N abundance of ammonia as the end product of nitrogen metabolism in the system; 2) pattern and 15N abundances of the protein-bound amino acids in the cells; 3) pattern and 15N abundances of free amino acids in the cells; and 4) pattern and 15N abundances of the amino acids in the culture medium. In addition to 15N emission spectrometry, a new gas chromatography/combustion interface-isotope ratio mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analytical system was used. The production and 15N content of ammonia were higher in the toluene-exposed system by 30% and 43%, respectively, indicating higher deamination rates and greater arginine consumption. The toluene-exposed cells exhibited increased 15N abundances of protein-bound amino acids in alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and tyrosine. Furthermore, structural analyses revealed the presence of N[Omega]-acetylarginine and pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid--compounds that had not previously been detected in Tetrahymena pyriformis. Differences in the 15N-enrichment of free amino acids were also evident. This new effect-monitoring system designed to investigate the impact of a pollutant on protein metabolism by using a stable isotope-labeled cell culture is a powerful tool for environmental medical research.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5"
1007,1998,17-beta-estradiol upregulates the stress response in Candida albicans: implications for microbial virulence.,"OBJECTIVE: The influence of 17-beta-estradiol on the stress response of Candida albicans was studied. METHODS: The survival of clinical isolates of C. albicans treated with 17-beta-estradiol after heat and oxidative stress was measured by viable plate counts. Cellular proteins were analyzed via SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: The heat stress response induced by 17-beta-estradiol in C. albicans grown at 25 degrees C protected the organisms against the lethal temperature of 48.5 degrees C, as shown by viable plate counts. 17-beta-estradiol also enhanced protection of C. albicans against oxidative stress (menadione exposure). SDS-PAGE analysis of cytoplasmic extracts revealed proteins induced by 17-beta-estradiol were similar to those induced by heat. CONCLUSION: 17-beta-estradiol enhances survival of C. albicans under heat and oxidative stresses. The proteins induced by 17-beta-estradiol are probably heat shock proteins. Because heat shock proteins are considered to be virulence factors, 17-beta-estradiol may function to promote in vivo survival."
1008,1998,1998 equivalence of sensory responses to single and mixed volatile organic compounds at equimolar concentrations.,"Exposure to low levels of chemicals indoors is often to a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). It is of interest to determine if the symptomatic and sensory responses can be attributed to a single chemical or to a mixture of chemicals. To determine if sensory or symptomatic responses differ with exposure to single or mixed VOCs, 100 female subjects participated in a 6-hr exposure study. Subjects were exposed to one of six equimolar concentrations equivalent to 24 mg/m3 toluene, control, m-xylene, n-butyl acetate, m-xylene plus n-butyl acetate, a mixture of 21 chemicals including n-butyl acetate and m-xylene, and to the same mixture of chemicals without n-butyl acetate and m-xylene (19 chemicals). The results indicated that there was no difference in reporting of symptoms or sensory responses between the exposures. When the control group was added, some variables, primarily odor intensity and nasal irritation, attained significance.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3"
1009,1998,1-Deazaadenosine: synthesis and activity of base-modified hammerhead ribozymes.,"The incorporation of 1-deazaadenosine (c1A, 1b) into a hammerhead ribozyme and the resulting catalytic activity is described. For this purpose the phosphoramidite 2a and the 3'-phosphonate 2b as well as Fractosil-linked 1-deazaadenosine (3b) were prepared. The methoxyacetyl group was used for the 6-amino group protection and the triisopropylsilyl residue was introduced as the 2'-OH protecting group. Replacement of residues A14and A15.1 of the hammerhead ribozyme by 1-deazaadenosine resulted in a significantly reduced catalytic activity. Substitution of the A6, A9 and A13 residues has only a minor influence. The findings observed on ribozymes modified with 1-deazaadenosine were compared with those containing other adenosine analogues."
1010,1998,(1--&gt;3)-beta-D-glucan and endotoxin modulate immune response to inhaled allergen.,"Exposure to dust may involve co-exposure to agents which are allergens, together with those which are pro-inflammatory. To study the effects of such a co-exposure, the humoral and inflammatory responses were studied in guinea pigs inhaling the T-cell-dependent antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and the inflammatory agents (1 --&gt; 3)-beta-D-glucan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The effects were evaluated as inflammatory cells in the lung and serum antibodies to OVA. LPS caused a stimulation of the OVA-induced antibody production which was abolished by simultaneous exposure to (1 --&gt; 3)-beta-D-glucan. An increase of eosinophils after OVA exposure was decreased by co-exposure to (1 --&gt; 3)-beta-D-glucan. The results demonstrate a complex interaction between adaptive and innate immune mechanisms in the lung, determined by exposure to common contaminants in airborne dust."
1011,1998,20 years of toxicology.,"With over 80,000 chemicals being used in commerce worldwide, it is important to identify the human health effects of these chemicals and the levels of exposure at which they are harmful to humans. In order to address this need, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) was established in 1978; since then, the NTP has become the world's leader in designing, conducting, and interpreting various types of toxicity assays."
1012,1998,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin plasma levels in Seveso 20 years after the accident.","In 1976, near Seveso, Italy, an industrial accident caused the release of large quantities of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) into the atmosphere, resulting in the highest levels of the toxicant ever recorded in humans. The contaminated area was divided into three zones (A, B, R) corresponding to decreasing TCDD levels in soil, and cohort including all residents was enumerated. The population of the surrounding noncontaminated area (non-ABR) was chosen as referent population. Two decades after the accident. plasma TCDD levels were measured in 62 subjects randomly sampled from the highest exposed zones (A and B) and 59 subjects from non-ABR, frequency matched for age, gender, and cigarette smoking status. Subjects living in the exposed areas have persistently elevated plasma TCDD levels (range = 1.2-89.9 ppt; geometric mean = 53.2 and 11.0 ppt for Zone A and Zone B, respectively). Levels significantly decrease by distance from the accident site (p = 0.0001), down to general population values (4.9 ppt) in non-ABR, thus validating the original zone classification based on environmental measurements. Women have higher TCDD levels than men in the entire study area (p = 0.0003 in Zone B; p = 0.007 in non-ABR). This gender difference persists after adjustment for location within the zone, consumption of meat derived from locally raised animals, age, body mass index, and smoking. There is no evidence for a gender difference in exposure, so variation in metabolism or elimination due to body fat or hormone-related factors may explain this finding. Elevated TCDD levels in women may contribute to adverse reproductive, developmental, and cancer outcomes.ImagesFigure 1"
1013,1998,2-Aminopurine as a fluorescent probe for DNA base flipping by methyltransferases.,"DNA base flipping, which was first observed for the C5-cytosine DNA methyltransferase M. Hha I, results in a complete removal of the stacking interactions between the target base and its neighbouring bases. We have investigated whether duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing the fluorescent base analogue 2-aminopurine can be used to sense DNA base flipping. Using M. Hha I as a paradigm for a base flipping enzyme, we find that the fluorescence intensity of duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing 2-aminopurine at the target site is dramatically enhanced (54-fold) in the presence of M. Hha I. Duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing 2-aminopurine adjacent to the target cytosine show little fluorescence increase upon addition of M. Hha I. These results clearly demonstrate that duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing 2-aminopurine at the target site can serve as fluorescence probes for base flipping. Another enzyme hypothesized to use a base flipping mechanism is the N6-adenine DNA methyltransferase M. Taq I. Addition of M. Taq I to duplex oligodeoxynucleotides bearing 2-aminopurine at the target position, also results in a strongly enhanced fluorescence (13-fold), whereas addition to duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing 2-aminopurine at the 3'- or 5'-neighbouring position leads only to small fluorescence increases. These results give the first experimental evidence that the adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase M. Taq I also flips its target base."
1014,1998,2-Aminopurine fluorescence studies of base stacking interactions at abasic sites in DNA: metal-ion and base sequence effects.,"Metal-ion and sequence dependent changes in the stacking interactions of bases surrounding abasic (AB) sites in 10 different DNA duplexes were examined by incorporating the fluorescent nucleotide probe 2-aminopurine (2-AP), opposite to the site (AB-APopp) or adjacent to the site (AB-APadj) on either strand. A detailed study of the fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of these AB duplexes and their corresponding parent duplexes indicates that AB-APoppis significantly less stacked than 2-AP in the corresponding normal duplex. In general, AB-APadjon the AB strand is stacked, but AB-APadjon the opposite strand shows destabilized stacking interactions. The results also indicate that divalent cation binding to the AB duplexes contributes to destabilizaton of the base stacking interactions of AB-APopp, but has little or no effect on the stacking interactions of AB-APadj. Consistent with these results, the fluorescence of AB-APoppis 18-30-fold more sensitive to an externally added quenching agent than the parent normal duplex. When uracil DNA glycosylase binds to AB-APoppin the presence of 2.5 mM MgCl2, a 3-fold decrease in fluorescence is observed ( K d = 400 +/- 90 nM) indicating that the unstacked 2-APoppbecomes more stacked upon binding. On the basis of these fluorescence studies a model for the local base stacking interactions at these AB sites is proposed."
1015,1998,"2'-Deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates modified at alpha-, beta- and gamma-phosphates as substrates for DNA polymerases.","Replacement of alpha-, beta- and gamma-phosphate groups in 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates (dNTP) with phosphonate groups yields a new set of dNTP mimics with potential biological and therapeutic applications. Here, we describe the synthesis of 15 new dNTPs modified at alpha-, beta- and gamma-phosphates containing, in the case of dUTP, reporter and ligand groups at the C5 position of uracil. It was shown that gamma-substituted dNTPs were substrates for AMV reverse transcriptase despite of the large size of substituent at the gamma-phosphonate. On the other hand, these compounds were poorly utilized by DNA polymerase alpha. For dUTP analogues substituted at both gamma-phosphonate and C5 of uracil, the substrate affinity was 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for their counterparts containing substituents either at gamma-phosphonate or C5 position. Meanwhile, C5-substituted beta, gamma-dibromomethylenediphosphonates demonstrated poor activity or were not active at all as substrates for AMV reverse transcriptase. Finally, 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-[beta, gamma-(methylphosphinyl)methylphosphonyl]-alpha-phosphate and its 3'-azido-3'-deoxy analog were substrates for AMV reverse transcriptase, but the substrate activity of these analogues was 50-100 times lower as compared with dTTP. HIV reverse transcriptase utilized these compounds 1 order of magnitude less efficiently than AMV reverse transcriptase; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase did not recognize them at all."
1016,1998,4'-Acylated thymidine 5'-triphosphates: a tool to increase selectivity towards HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.,"4'-Acylated thymidines represent a new class of DNA chain terminators, since they have been shown to act as post-incorporation chain-terminating nucleotides despite the presence of a free 3'-hydroxyl group. Here, we describe the action of the 4'-acetyl- (MeTTP) and 4'-propanoylthymidine 5'-triphosphate (EtTTP) on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis and on DNA synthesis catalyzed by the cellular DNA polymerases alpha, beta, delta and epsilon. MeTTP exhibits a high selectivity towards HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. By the use of the bulkier propanoyl group as the 4'-substituent of the nucleoside 5'-triphosphate, selectivity towards HIV-1 reverse transcriptase could be increased without affecting substrate efficiency. Thus, 4'-modifications may serve as a tool to increase selectivity towards HIV-1 reverse transcriptase."

Subject: Thirty-three morbidly obese persons, after multiple attempts for weight loss. Design: Intragastric 1000 cc balloons were endoscopically inserted into the stomachs of subjects. The balloons were left in place for six months. During that period the patients received dietary therapy. Hormone levels were measured prior to insertion and upon withdrawal of balloons. Results: After a brief initial weight loss, most patients regained the weight initially lost. Mean weight loss after six months was only 8 kg (range 0‰ÛÒ22 kg). We found that Bombesin levels, but not Gastrin levels, were significantly lower at the end of therapy than before insertion of the balloon. Conclusion: We conclude that a large intragastric balloon for a prolonged time did not assist in weight loss. Our preliminary results show Bombesin levels change significantly, a finding which warrants further study."
1019,1998,A 7-methylguanosine cap commits U3 and U8 small nuclear RNAs to the nucleolar localization pathway.,"U3 and U8 small nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs) participate in pre-rRNA processing. Like the U1, U2, U4 and U5 major spliceosomal snRNAs, U3 and U8 RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and their initial 7-methylguanosine (m7G) 5' cap structures subsequently become converted to 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine. However, unlike the polymerase II transcribed spliceosomal snRNAs, which are exported to the cytoplasm for cap hypermethylation, U3 and U8 RNAs undergo cap hypermethylation within the nucleus. Human U3 and U8 RNAs with various cap structures were generated by in vitro transcription, fluorescently labeled and microinjected into nuclei of normal rat kidney (NRK) epithelial cells. When U3 and U8 RNAs containing a m7G cap were microinjected they became extensively localized in nucleoli. U3 and U8 RNAs containing alternative cap structures did not localize in nucleoli nor did U3 or U8 RNAs containing triphosphate 5'-termini. The nucleolar localization of m7G-capped U3 RNA was competed by co-microinjection into the nucleus of a 100-fold molar excess of dinucleotide m7GpppG but not by a 100-fold excess of ApppG dinucleotide. Although it was obviously not possible to assess formation of di- and trimethylguanosine caps on the microinjected U3 and U8 RNAs in these single cell experiments, these results indicate that the initial presence of a m7G cap on U3 and U8 RNAs, most likely together with internal sequence elements, commits these transcripts to the nucleolar localization pathway and point to diverse roles of the m7G cap in the intracellular traffic of various RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II."

1022,1998,Abnormal directed migration of blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes in rheumatoid arthritis. Potential role in increased susceptibility to bacterial infections.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are at higher risks of bacterial infection than healthy subjects. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are the first line of nonspecific cellular defence against these infections. We tested the hypothesis that abnormal directed migration of PMN may be one reason for the increased infection rate of RA patients. PMN migration was investigated in 68 peripheral blood samples of 15 RA patients compared with 64 samples of healthy controls in a novel whole blood in vitro membrane filter assay. The migration of PMNs from RA patients and controls was stimulated using the bacterial chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Unstimulated PMN migration of RA patients was increased compared with healthy controls as measured by the following parameters: (a) absolute number of migrant PMNs (1954+/-87 vs. 1238 +/-58 PMN/mm2), (b) percentage of PMNs migrated into the filter (total migration index, TMI) (28.6+/-0.9 vs. 24.0+/-0.8%), (c) the distance half the migrating PMNs had covered (distribution characteristic, DC) (22.6+/-1.1 vs. 16.1+/-0.6 mm) and (d) the product of TMI and DC (neutrophil migratory activity, NMA) (669.0+/-45.0 vs. 389.0+/-18.9). fMLP stimulated PMNs of RA patients showed defective migration compared to unstimulated samples as shown by (a) a reduced number of migrant PMNs (1799+/-93 PMN/mm2), (b) lower TMI (26.1+/-0.9%), (c) unremarkable altered distribution characteristic (22.9+/-0.8 mm) and (d) significant reduced migratory activity (600.0+/-30.0). Our data suggest that the high incidence of infections in RA patients may partly be caused by defective migratory activity of PMNs to bacterial chemoattractants as demonstrated by fMLP."
1023,1998,Abnormal gastric morphology and function in CCK-B/gastrin receptor-deficient mice.,"Mice lacking the cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptor have been generated by targeted gene disruption. The roles of this receptor in controlling gastric acid secretion and gastric mucosal growth have been assessed. The analysis of homozygous mutant mice vs. wild type included measurement of basal gastric pH, plasma gastrin concentrations as well as quantification of gastric mucosal cell types by immunohistochemistry. Mutant mice exhibited a marked increase in basal gastric pH (from 3.2 to 5.2) and about a 10-fold elevation in circulating carboxyamidated gastrin compared with wild-type controls. Histologic analysis revealed a decrease in both parietal and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, thus explaining the reduction in acid output. Consistent with the elevation in circulating gastrin, antral gastrin cells were increased in number while somatostatin cells were decreased. These data support the importance of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor in maintaining the normal cellular composition and function of the gastric mucosa.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3"
1024,1998,A broader role for AU-rich element-mediated mRNA turnover revealed by a new transcriptional pulse strategy.,"The widespread occurrence of AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNAs encoding proteins with diversified functions and synthesized under a vast variety of physiological conditions suggests that AREs are involved in finely tuned and stringent control of gene expression. Thus it is important to investigate the regulation of ARE-mediated mRNA decay in a variety of mammalian cells in different physiological states. The tetracycline (Tet)-regulatory promoter system appears appropriate for these investigations. However, we found that efficient degradation of mRNAs bearing different AREs cannot be observed simply by blocking constitutive transcription from the Tet-regulated promoter with Tet, possibly due to saturation of the cellular decay machinery. In addition, deadenylation kinetics and their relationship to mRNA decay cannot be adequately measured under these conditions. To overcome these obstacles we have developed a new strategy that employs the Tet-regulated promoter system to achieve a transient burst of transcription that results in synthesis of a population of cytoplasmic mRNAs fairly homogeneous in size. Using this new system we show that ARE-destabilizing function, necessary for down-regulating mRNAs for cytokines, growth factors and transcription factors, is maintained in quiescent or growth-arrested cells as well as in saturation density-arrested NIH 3T3 cells. We also demonstrate that the ARE-mediated decay pathway is conserved between NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and K562 erythroblasts. These in vivo observations support a broader role for AREs in the control of cell growth and differentiation. In addition, we observed that there is a significant difference in deadenylation and decay rates for beta-globin mRNA expressed in these two cell lines. Deadenylation and decay of beta-globin mRNA in K562 cells is extraordinarily slow compared with NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the increased stability gained by beta-globin mRNA in K562 cells is mainly controlled at the deadenylation step. Our strategy for studying mammalian mRNA turnover now permits a more general application to different cell lines harboring the Tet-regulated system under various physiological conditions."

The speed (&lt;2 min separations) and simplicity derive from the use of an uncoated capillary with no gel matrix. The dissociation constant for GCNK58, a DNA-binding-region construct of the yeast transcription factor GCN4, binding to the AP1 DNA site was measured ( K d = 35 +/- 4 nM) to demonstrate the utility of the method."
1030,1998,A Case of a Laboratory Animal Feed with High Estrogenic Activity and Its Impact on in Vivo Responses to Exogenously Administered Estrogens,
1031,1998,A case of a laboratory animal feed with high estrogenic activity and its impact on in vivo responses to exogenously administered estrogens.,"We recently noted that immature rats failed to exhibit a normal uterine response to exogenously administered estradiol as assessed by both biochemical (induction of gene expression) and morphological (altered uterine and vaginal histology and size) end points. An initial analysis suggested that this was due to a high degree of estrogenization from a dietary source which was producing a near maximal uterotrophic response prior to hormone treatment. Subsequent chemical analysis indicated that the feed in question contained high amounts of two well-known phytoestrogens, genistein (210 mg/kg) and daidzen (14 mg/kg), and the lot of feed in question produced a large uterotrophic effect when fed to immature ovariectomized rats. These findings illustrate that, despite increased awareness of phytoestrogens, some batches of animal feed contain very high amounts of estrogenic components which have marked effects on in vivo end points of hormone action. These observations have important implications for both basic research and screening methods that utilize in vivo approaches.ImagesFigure 2Figure 3"
1032,1998,A CASE OF LEPTOMENINGEAL DISEASE PRESENTING AS A LUMBAR NERVE ROOT RADICULOPATHY,"Objective: To discuss a case of leptomenigeal disease mimicking a lower lumbar disc lesion and accompanying neurological deficit.Clinical Features: A 62 year old male presented with a 3-4 day history of left low back and left posterior thigh pain. The patient had a previous history of non-specific low back pain for approximately 10-25 years, which was relieved in the past by manual therapy. He was also currently being treated by a medical oncologist with chemotherapy for low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which was considered stable.Intervention and Outcome: After a favourable initial response to therapy, the patient developed a noticeable left-sided limp. Computed tomography scanning of the lumbar spine and pelvis was then performed, which revealed a mild posterior annular bulging of the intervertebral disc at the L4/5 level. The patient was then treated with axial lumbar spine traction but on review two days later had also developed a left sided facial droop, consistent with a Bell's palsy. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and lumbar spine revealed sites of abnormal enhancement of multiple cranial nerves, the cauda equina and the vertebral bodies L1 and L5. The findings were consistent with widespread leptomeningeal disease or leptomenigeal carcinomatosis and unfortunately the patient died as a direct consequence of the disease approximately three weeks after diagnosis.Conclusion: Although relatively rare, leptomenigeal disease must considered as a differential diagnosis in a patient with a history of carcinoma who presents with low back pain and/or any neurological signs and symptoms."
1033,1998,A Case of Pill-Induced Esophagitis With Mucosal Dissection,"With the advance of gastrointestinal endoscopy, pill-induced esophagitis has been detected more frequently, but the association of mucosal dissection is rare. We reported a case of pill-induced esophagitis associated with mucosal dissection. A 66-year-old male with combined valvular heart disease was admitted for cardiac surgery. Cefotiam hydrochloride tablet was administered for postoperative wound infection of cardiac surgery. Next morning severe odynophagia and retrosternal pain were occurred. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed 2 days after onset of the symptom showed detached mucosa at the upper thoracic esophagus and acute esophagitis at middle and lower thoracic esophagus. Histological examination of the mucosa revealed that the esophageal mucosa was detached from the lamina propria. After the treatment for esophagitis, almost normal esophageal mucosa covered the esophagus without scarring or stricture. The present case was diagnosed as cefotiam hydrochloride tablet induced esophagitis because of the onset of this disease. Mucosal dissection of the esophagus may be associated with both the esophagitis and bleeding tendencies caused by anticoagulant therapy."
1034,1998,"A case study in innovative outreach--combining training, research, and technology transfer to address real-world problems.","Outreach, training, technology transfer, and research are often treated as programmatically distinct activities. The interdisciplinary and applied aspects of the Superfund Basic Research Program offer an opportunity to explore different models. A case study is presented that describes a collaborative outreach effort that combines all of the above. It involves the University of California's Davis and Berkeley program projects, the University of California Systemwide Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program, the U.S. Navy's civilian workforce at the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California (MINSY), a Department of Defense (DoD) Environmental Education Demonstration Grant program, and the Private Industry Council of Napa and Sonoma counties in California. The effort applied a Superfund-developed technology to a combined waste, radium and polychlorinated biphenyl contamination, stemming from a problematic removal action at an installation/restoration site at MINSY. The effort demonstrates that opportunities for similar collaborations are possible at DoD installations."
1035,1998,Accelerated mRNA decay in conditional mutants of yeast mRNA capping enzyme.,"Current models of mRNA decay in yeast posit that 3' deadenylation precedes enzymatic removal of the 5' cap, which then exposes the naked end to 5' exonuclease action. Here, we analyzed gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells bearing conditional mutations of Ceg1 (capping enzyme), a 52 kDa protein that transfers GMP from GTP to the 5' end of mRNA to form the GpppN cap structure. Shift of ceg1 mutants to restrictive temperature elicited a rapid decline in the rate of protein synthesis, which correlated with a sharp reduction in the steady-state levels of multiple individual mRNAs. ceg1 mutations prevented the accumulation of SSA1 and SSA4 mRNAs that were newly synthesized at the restrictive temperature. Uncapped poly(A)+ SSA4 mRNA accumulated in cells lacking the 5' exoribonuclease Xrn1. These findings provide genetic evidence for the long-held idea that the cap guanylate is critical for mRNA stability. The deadenylation-decapping-degradation pathway appears to be short-circuited when Ceg1 is inactivated."
1036,1998,Accumulation of chlorpyrifos on residential surfaces and toys accessible to children.,"Quantitative examination of major pathways and routes of exposure to pesticides is essential for determining human risk. The current study was conducted in two apartments and examines the accumulation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in childrens' toys after the time suggested for reentry after application. It has been established for the first time that a semivolatile pesticide will accumulate on and in toys and other sorbant surfaces in a home via a two-phase physical process that continues for at least 2 weeks postapplication. A summation of the above for a 3-6-year-old child yielded an estimated nondietary total dose of 208 microg/kg/day. Potential exposure from the inhalation pathway was negligible, while dermal and nondietary oral doses from playing with toys contributed to 39 and 61% of the total dose, respectively. If children with high frequency mouthing behavior are considered as candidates for acute exposure to chlorpyrifos residues, the estimated acute dose could be as high as 356 microg/kg/day. Routine reapplication of pesticides could lead to continued accumulation in toys and other sorbant surfaces, e.g., pillows, with large sorbant reservoirs, which can become a long-term source of exposure to a child. Estimates of a child's nondietary exposure to chlorpyrifos associated with toys and other sorbant surfaces for a period of 1 week following application appear to be of public health concern, and studies of actual childhood exposure from this pathway are warranted in the home environment. The above information should be used to determine if current procedures for postapplication reentry are sufficient and to evaluate the need for procedures to store frequently used household toys, pillows, and other sorbant objects during insecticidal application.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5Figure 6"
1037,1998,Accuracy and economics of Helicobacter pylori diagnosis.,"Many diagnostic tests are available to establish Helicobacter pylori infection status. Most of the tests are accurate though none works perfectly, and no gold standard for diagnosis exists. Newly developed serum immunoassay kits can substitute for laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, but whole blood immunoassays do not yet demonstrate adequate performance characteristics. Serologic diagnosis of H. pylori remains the most cost-effective option and should be utilized to establish initial infection in the majority of cases. If rapid urease testing is performed at endoscopy, negative results can be confirmed with a subsequent serologic test in those patients with a high probability of infection. Obtaining additional gastric tissue at endoscopy to evaluate for bacterial infection is reasonable if specimens are being taken for a mucosal defect. Confirmation of bacterial eradication cannot be justified for all post-treatment patients at present due to the expense. It is important to test for cure in those patients with complicated ulcer disease and those with recurrent symptoms after therapy."
1038,1998,A central region of Ku80 mediates interaction with Ku70 in vivo.,"Ku, the DNA binding component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), is a heterodimer composed of 70 and 86 kDa subunits, known as Ku70 and Ku80 respectively . Defects in DNA-PK subunits have been shown to result in a reduced capacity to repair DNA double-strand breaks. Assembly of the Ku heterodimer is required to obtain DNA end binding activity and association of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit. The regions of the Ku subunits responsible for heterodimerization have not been clearly defined in vivo . A previous study has suggested that the C-terminus of Ku80 is required for interaction with Ku70. Here we examine Ku subunit interaction using N- and C-terminal Ku80 deletions in a GAL4-based two-hybrid system and an independent mammalian in vivo system. Our two-hybrid study suggests that the central region of Ku80, not its C-terminus, is capable of mediating interaction with Ku70. To determine if this region mediates interaction with Ku70 in mammalian cells we transfected xrs-6 cells, which lack endogenous Ku80, with epitope-tagged Ku80 deletions carrying a nuclear localization signal. Immunoprecipitation from transfected cell extracts revealed that the central domain identified by the GAL4 two-hybrid studies stabilizes and co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous xrs-6 Ku70. The central interaction domain maps to the internally deleted regions of Ku80 in the mutant cell lines XR-V9B and XR-V15B. These findings indicate that the internally deleted Ku80 mutations carried in these cell lines are incapable of heterodimerization with Ku70."
1039,1998,"aCHEdb: the database system for ESTHER, the alpha/beta fold family of proteins and the Cholinesterase gene server.","Acetylcholinesterase belongs to a family of proteins, the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family, whose constituents evolutionarily diverged from a common ancestor and share a similar structure of a central beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices. These proteins fulfil a wide range of physiological functions (hydrolases, adhesion molecules, hormone precursors) [Krejci,E., Duval,N., Chatonnet,A., Vincens,P. and MassouliÌ©,J. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 88, 6647-6651]. ESTHER (for esterases, alpha/beta hydrolase enzymes and relatives) is a database aimed at collecting in one information system, sequence data together with biological annotations and experimental biochemical results related to the structure-function analysis of the enzymes of the family. The major upgrade of the database comes from the use of a new database management system: aCHEdb which uses the ACeDB program designed by Richard Durbin and Jean Thierry-Mieg. It can be found at http://www.ensam.inra.fr/cholinesterase"
1040,1998,"A chimeric Cre recombinase inducible by synthetic,but not by natural ligands of the glucocorticoid receptor.","We have developed a new ligand-dependent chimeric recombinase (Cre-GRdex) by fusing the site-specific Cre recombinase to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of a mutant human glucocorticoid receptor (GRdex). The synthetic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands dexamethasone, triamcinolone acetonide and RU38486efficiently induce recombinase activity in F9 murine embryonal carcinoma cells expressing constitutively Cre-GRdex. In contrast, no recombinase activity was detected in the absence of ligand or in the presence of the natural GR ligands corticosterone, cortisol or aldosterone. Moreover, physiological concentrations of these natural GR ligands do not affect Cre-GRdexrecombinase activity induced by dexamethasone. Thus, as previously shown using Cre-oestrogen receptor (ER) fusion proteins, Cre-GRdexmight be useful for achieving loxP site-directed mutagenesis in cultured cells and spatio-temporally controlled somatic cell mutagenesis in transgenic mice."
1041,1998,Acidosis activates complement system in vitro.,"We investigated the in vitro effect of different forms of acidosis (pH 7.0) on the formation of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Metabolic acidosis due to addition of hydrochloric acid (10 micromol/ml blood) or lactic acid (5.5 micromol/ml) to heparin blood (N=12) caused significant activation of C3a and C5a compared to control (both p=0.002). Respiratory acidosis activated C3a (p=0.007) and C5a (p=0.003) compared to normocapnic controls. Making blood samples with lactic acidosis hypocapnic resulted in a median pH of 7.37. In this respiratory compensated metabolic acidosis, C3a and C5a were not increased. These experiments show that acidosis itself and not lactate trigger for activation of complement components C3 and C5."
1042,1998,A Clinical Study of Photodynamic Therapy for Superficial Esophageal Carcinoma by YAG-OPO Laser,"A cooperative clinical study of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for superficial esophageal carcinoma was conducted at 6 medical institution. PHE (2mg/kg) with high tumor affinity was used as the oncotropic compound. The light source was a pulse wave YAG-OPO laser with high penetration into the tissue. Irradiation was performed at an energy density of 60‰ÛÒ180 J/cm2 48‰ÛÒ72 h after PHE administration. Eight lesions in 6 patients were treated. All were type 0-II superficial carcinomas. The depth of invasion was EP‰ÛÒMM for 6 lesions and SM for 2 lesions. A complete response (CR) was achieved in all patients after one session of PDT. Five adverse events, including anemia and fever, were reported by 4 patients, but all were WHO grade 2 or lower and transient. PDT using PHE and YAG-OPO laser was therefore considered effective as a curative therapy for superficial esophageal carcinoma."
1043,1998,A cluster of suspected Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia following intensive chemotherapy in a Belfast haematology unit.,"Five cases of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were diagnosed in adult patients following intensive chemotherapy in the Royal Group of Hospitals haematology unit, Belfast, within a space of six months. The common features and the risk factors contributing to the increased susceptibility of these patients are discussed, as are the likely mechanisms of transmission of infection."
1044,1998,A common 40 amino acid motif in eukaryotic RNases H1 and caulimovirus ORF VI proteins binds to duplex RNAs.,"Eukaryotic RNases H from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Crithidia fasciculata , unlike the related Escherichia coli RNase HI, contain a non-RNase H domain with a common motif. Previously we showed that S.cerevisiae RNase H1 binds to duplex RNAs (either RNA-DNA hybrids or double-stranded RNA) through a region related to the double-stranded RNA binding motif. A very similar amino acid sequence is present in caulimovirus ORF VI proteins. The hallmark of the RNase H/caulimovirus nucleic acid binding motif is a stretch of 40 amino acids with 11 highly conserved residues, seven of which are aromatic. Point mutations, insertions and deletions indicated that integrity of the motif is important for binding. However, additional amino acids are required because a minimal peptide containing the motif was disordered in solution and failed to bind to duplex RNAs, whereas a longer protein bound well. Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNase H1 also bound to duplex RNAs, as did proteins in which the S.cerevisiae RNase H1 binding motif was replaced by either the C.fasciculata or by the cauliflower mosaic virus ORF VI sequence. The similarity between the RNase H and the caulimovirus domain suggest a common interaction with duplex RNAs of these two different groups of proteins."
1045,1998,A comparative study of the thermal stability of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-substituted 2'-deoxyuridines.,"Two series of modified oligonucleotides based on the self-complementary dodecamer d(CGCTAATTAGCG) were synthesized. The first contained the -C identical withCCH2R linker at C5 of deoxyuridine at position 4 (T*) of d(CGCT*AATTAGCG) and the second contained the -SR linker. The goal of the study was to evaluate and compare these two types of side chains for suitability as tethers for linking reporter groups to oligonucleotides. Our primary concern was how these tethers would effect duplex stability. The modified nucleosides were synthesized by palladium-mediated coupling reactions between the substituted alkyne and 5'-(4, 4'-dimethoxytrityl)-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and between a disulfide and 5-chloromercurio-2'-deoxyuridine. The C5 deoxyuridine side chains evaluated included C identical with CCH3, C identical with CCH2NHC(O)CH3, C identical with CCH2N(CH3)2, C identical with CCH2N-HC(O)C5H4N, C identical with CCH2NHC(O)C10H15, SCH3, SC6H5 and SCH2CH2NHC(O)CH3. The nucleosides containing these substituents were incorporated into oligo-deoxyribonucleotides by standard phosphoramidite methodology. Melting studies demonstrated that the sequence containing the C identical with CCH3side chain had the highest T m value (59.1 degrees C) in comparison with the control sequence (T m = 55.2 degrees C) and that any additional substituent on C3 of the propynyl group lowered the T m value relative to propynyl. Nevertheless, even the most destabilizing substituent, adamantylcarbamoyl, yielded an oligodeoxyribonucleotide that dissociated with a T m of 54 degrees C, which is only 1.2 degrees C less than the control sequence. In contrast, the thioether substituents led to lower T m values, ranging from as low as 45.1 degrees C for SPh up to 52.2 degrees C for SMe. Replacing the methyl of the SMe substituent with a CH2CH2NHC(O)CH3 tether led to no further reduction in melting temperature. The T m value of the CH2CH2NHC(O)CH3-containing oligonucleotide was less than the natural sequence by 1.6 degrees C/substituent. This is sufficiently small that it is anticipated that the C5 thioether linkage may be as useful as the acetylenic linkage for tethering reporter groups to oligonucleotides. More importantly, the thioether linkage provides a means to position functional groups to interact specifically with opposing complementary (target) sequences."
1046,1998,A comparison of ligase chain reaction to polymerase chain reaction in the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis endocervical infections.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the reliability of ligase chain reaction (LCR) to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in detecting Chlamydia trachomatis endocervical infections. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 486 patients at risk for chlamydial infection of the endocervix. We obtained two endocervical specimens from each patient and used LCR and PCR to detect C. trachomatis. Discrepant results between the two techniques were resolved by repeat testing and by testing for the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) gene, if necessary. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for each test, using concordant results or MOMP gene results as the ""gold standard"". RESULTS: Of the 486 patients, 42 (8.6%) had evidence of C. trachomatis infection after resolution of discrepant results. Of the 42 true positive specimens, 41 were positive by initial LCR and 38 were positive by initial PCR. Of the 444 true negative specimens, none had a positive initial LCR result, while 2 had a positive initial PCR test. Therefore, compared to the gold standard, LCR had a sensitivity of 97.6% and specificity of 100%, while PCR had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 99.5%. The positive and negative predictive values of LCR were 100% and 99.8%, respectively. PCR had a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative predictive value of 99.1%. The difference in sensitivity of LCR versus PCR was not statistically significant (P = .125). CONCLUSION: LCR and PCR perform equally well in detecting C. trachomatis endocervical infections."
1047,1998,A Comparison of Outcome of Osteoarticular Allograft Reconstruction and Shoulder Arthrodesis Following Resection of Primary Tumours of the Proximal Humerus,"Purpose. The purpose of this study was to compare the oncologic, reconstructive and functional outcomes of patients who underwent osteoarticular allograft reconstruction with those who underwent arthrodesis for a primary malignant bone tumour of the proximal humerus. Patients. Eleven patients were treated with osteoarticular allograft reconstruction of the proximal humerus. Five of these reconstructions failed, necessitating revision to a secondary arthrodesis. Five patients underwent arthrodesis as a primary reconstruction, for a total of ten patients in the arthrodesis group. Methods. End points included local and systemic disease recurrence, complications and functional outcome (measured using the 1987 and 1993 Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Rating Scales (MSTS) and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS)). Results. One patient died of systemic disease 2 years post-operatively and one patient had an axillary node recurrence resected 10 months post-operatively and remains free of disease 53 months later. The other 14 patients were alive with no evidence of disease at the time of the last follow-up. Complications after the osteochondral allografts (n=11) included two infections, four fractures and three subluxations in eight patients. Six of these patients required removal of the allograft; one had a repeat osteochondral allograft and five were converted to an arthrodesis. Complications after arthrodesis in the ten patients (five primary and five secondary arthrodeses) included two non-unions, one infection and one fracture in three patients. Patients who underwent shoulder arthrodesis scored better in all outcome measures and this was statistically significant in the MSTS 1993 (p=0.001, Mann‰ÛÒWhitney U Test). Discussion. In this study, there was a trend towards improved function following arthrodesis compared to osteochondral allograft reconstruction following proximal humerus bone tumour resection."
1048,1998,A conserved structural element in horse and mouse IGF2 genes binds a methylation sensitive factor.,"The equine IGF2 gene has been cloned and characterised. It spans a 9 kb region, which is substantially less than the corresponding human gene. Three coding exons and three untranslated leader exons, all highly homologous to those in other species, were identified. Downstream of the polyadenylation site in exon 6, a dinucleotide repeat sequence was identified. Three putative promoters (P1-P3) were localised in the 5' region of the gene. RNase protection analysis revealed two active promoters in fetal tissues, P2 and P3, whereas P3 was the only promoter active in adult tissues. This represents a transcriptional pattern different from that in humans or rodents. A novel structural element, an inverted repeat, is predicted in the 3' region of the IGF2 gene. This repeat is conserved between species and located in a region which is differentially methylated in the human and mouse genes and might therefore be involved in the imprinting mechanism. The inverted repeat acquires a stem-loop structure in vitro with a hybrid A/B-DNA conformation in the stem area. Both in horse and mouse, a methylation-sensitive protein binds this structure with a strong requirement for the loop area. Furthermore, the protein might be developmentally regulated."
1049,1998,A contiguous 60 kb genomic stretch from barley reveals molecular evidence for gene islands in a monocot genome.,"The contiguous DNA sequence of a 60 kb genomic interval of barley chromosome 4HL has been assembled. The region harbours a single and novel gypsy -like retrotransposon, designated BAGY-1. Only three genes appear to reside in the genomic stretch. One predicts a plant homologue of ribophorin I, a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase-protein complex located in the rough endoplasmatic reticulum. The second is similar to the Drosophila g1 gene encoding a ring finger protein involved in developmental processes. The observed gene density is approximately 5-fold lower than in the best characterized dicot genome of Arabidopsis but 6- to 10-fold higher than expected from an equidistant gene distribution in the complex barley genome. Our data suggest that the 60 kb genomic interval represents part of a gene island, a seemingly distinctive feature of grass genomes."
1050,1998,A convenient method of aligning large DNA molecules on bare mica surfaces for atomic force microscopy.,"Large DNA molecules remain difficult to be imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) because of the tendency of aggregation. A method is described to align long DNA fibers in a single direction on unmodified mica to facilitate AFM studies. The clear background, minimal overstretching, high reproducibility and convenience of this aligning procedure make it useful for physical mapping of genome regions and the studies of DNA-protein complexes."
1051,1999,2'-Pyrene modified oligonucleotide provides a highly sensitive fluorescent probe of RNA.,"Oligonucleotide 9mers containing 2'-O-(1-pyrenylmethyl)uridine [U(pyr)] at the center position were synthesized by using a protected U(pyr) phosphoramidite. The UV melting behaviors indicate that the pyrene-modified oligonucleotides can bind to both their complementary DNA and RNA in aqueous solution. When compared with the unmodified oligonucleotides, the pyrene-modified oligonucleotides showed higher affinity for DNA while exhibiting lower affinity for RNA. The pyrene-modified oligonucleotides in diluted solution exhibited fluorescence typical of pyrene monomer emission [lambdamax 378 (band I) and 391 nm (band III)]. When these oligomers bound to DNA, the fluorescence intensity ratio of band III/band I was increased. With this fluorescence change, a new broad emission (lambdamax 450 nm) due to exciplex between the pyrene and an adjacent nucleobase appeared. In contrast, addition of RNA to the pyrene oligonucleotides resulted in enhancement of the pyrene monomer emission with decrease in the fluorescence band ratio. The extent of the emission enhancement was found to be highly dependent on the nucleobase adjacent to the U(pyr) in the pyrene oligomers. The pyrene oligonucleotide containing dC at the 3'-site of the modification showed remarkable increase (approximately 250 times) in fluorescence (375 nm) upon binding to complementary RNA. The present findings would open the way to the design of a highly sensitive fluorescent probe of RNA."
1052,1999,"3,N(4)-ethano-2'-deoxycytidine: chemistry of incorporation into oligomeric DNA and reassessment of miscoding potential.","3,N(4)-Ethano-2'-deoxycytidine (ethano-dC) may be incorporated successfully into synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides by omitting the capping procedure used in the automated DNA synthetic protocols immediately after inserting the lesion and in all iterations thereafter. Ethano-dC is sensitive to acetic anhydride found in the capping reagent, and multiple oligomeric products are formed. These products were identified by examining the reaction of ethano-dC with the capping reagent, and several acetylated, ring-opened products were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry and collision induced dissociation experiments on a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. A scheme for the formation of the acetylated products is proposed. In addition, the mutagenic profile of ethano-dC was re-examined and compared to that for etheno-dC. Ethano-dC is principally a blocking lesion; however, when encountered by the exo(-)Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, dAMP (22%), TMP (16%), dGMP (5.3%) and dCMP (1.2%) were all incorporated opposite ethano-dC, along with an oligomer containing a one-base deletion (0.6%)."
1053,1999,3'-Terminal RNA structures and poly(U) tracts inhibit initiation by a 3'--&gt;5' exonuclease in vitro.,"We have previously shown that the presence of a poly(A) tail blocks the activity of a highly efficient 3'--&gt;5' exonuclease in HeLa extracts. Similar activities have been implicated in RNA turnover in vivo. It is not clear, however, what protects poly(A)-non-mRNAs from the action of this enzyme. A stem-loop structure located at the 3'-end of U11 RNA was required to protect this transcript from the exonuclease in vitro. Similar 3' stem-loop structures, or extensive base pairinginvolving the 3'-end, are present on all mature small stable RNAs. The placement of artificial stem-loop structures at the 3'-end also protected RNA substrates, suggesting that RNA structure alone is sufficient to block the initiation of the exonuclease. The placement of RNA structures at internal positions of substrate trans-cripts did not affect the activity of the exonuclease or lead to the accumulation of degradation intermediates. Pol III precursor transcripts contain short poly(U) tracts rather than structure at their 3'-ends. Terminal poly(U) tracts protected RNA substrates from the 3'--&gt;5' exonuclease in a protein-dependent fashion. Although La protein is found associated with the terminal U tracts of pol III precursor transcripts both in vivo and in vitro, La protein was not required for poly(U) to protect RNA substrates from the 3'--&gt;5' exonuclease. In summary, these data reveal a variety of ways RNAs have evolved to protect themselves from this exonuclease."
1054,1999,5-(1-propargylamino)-2'-deoxyuridine (UP): a novel thymidine analogue for generating DNA triplexes with increased stability.,"We have used quantitative DNase I footprinting and UV-melting studies to examine the formation of DNA triplexes in which the third strand thymines have been replaced by 5-propargylamino-dU (UP). The intra-molecular triplex A6-L-T6-L-(UP)5T (L = two octanediol residues) shows a single UV-melting transition which is &gt;20 degrees higher than that of the parent triplex A6-L-T6-L-T6at pH 5.5. Although a single transition is observed at all pHs, the melting temperature (Tm) of the modified oligonucleotide decreases at higher pHs, consistent with the requirement for protonation of the amino group. A similar intramolecular triplex with a longer overhanging duplex shows two melting transitions, the lower of which is stabilised by substitution of T by UP, in a pH dependent fashion. Triplex stability increases by approximately 12 K for each T to UP substitution. Quantitative footprinting studies have examined the interaction of three UP-containing 9mer oligonucleotides with the different portions of the 17mer sequence 5'-AGGAAGAGAAAAAAGAA. At pH 5.0, the UP-containing oligo-nucleotides footprint to much lower concentrations than their T-containing counterparts. In particular (UP)6CUPT binds approximately 1000-fold more tightly than the unmodified oligonucleotide T6CTT. Oligonucleotides containing fewer UP residues are stabilised to a lesser extent. The affinity of these modified third strands decreases at higher pHs. These results demonstrate that the stability of DNA triplexes can be dramatically increased by using positively charged analogues of thymine."
1055,1999,5-Aminolaevulinic Acid (ALA) for the Fluorescence Detection of Bronchial Tumors,"At the moment only early detection of lung cancer offers a good prognosis for the patients. Conventional white light endoscopy is mostly insufficient for early diagnosis. Therefore we developed a system of fluorescence diagnosis using 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) exogeneously applied. As precursor of the heme synthesis it is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX ‰ÛÒ a red fluorescent substance. Therefore protoporphyrin IX accumulates in tumorous and premalignant tissue, and can be directly visualized by fluorescence bronchoscopy. Excitation with blue light (380‰ÛÒ435 nm) causes a red fluorescence, which can be detected after filtering most of the blue component with the naked eye or a camera system. After earlier work with laser systems and cold light sources we now use the system D-Light AF for the fluorescence diagnosis using ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX fluorescence."

1057,1999,5S rRNA gene deletions cause an unexpectedly high fitness loss in Escherichia coli.,"In Escherichia coli, ribosomal RNAs (16S, 23S and 5S) are co-transcribed in a highly regulated manner from seven genomically dispersed operons. Previous studies on the cellular effects of altered levels of two of these rRNAs (16S and 23S) have been useful in better understanding the regulation of rRNA expression. Furthering these studies, we have investigated the effect of 5S rRNA deficiencies on cell fitness through the sequential deletion of 5S rRNA genes. Our findings indicate that the loss of 5S rDNA from multiple genes decreases cell fitness more rapidly than loss of a similar number of 16S and 23S rRNA genes. These results suggest that the cell's innate ability to up-regulate rRNA operons does not compensate for 5S rRNA deficiencies, as was previously shown for 16S and 23S rRNAs. A plasmid-borne 5S rRNA gene is able to compensate for the deleted 5S rRNA genes."
1058,1999,6-Thioguanine alters the structure and stability of duplex DNA and inhibits quadruplex DNA formation.,"The ability to chemically synthesize biomolecules has opened up the opportunity to observe changes in structure and activity that occur upon single atom substitution. In favorable cases this can provide information about the roles of individual atoms. The substitution of 6-thioguanine (6SG) for guanine is a potentially very useful single atom substitution as 6SG has optical, photocrosslinking, metal ion binding and other properties of potential utility. In addition, 6-mercaptopurine is a clinically important pro-drug that is activated by conversion into 6SG by cells. The results presented here indicate that the presence of 6SG blocks the formation of quadruplex DNA. The presence of 6SG alters the structure and lowers the thermal stability of duplex DNA, but duplex DNA can be formed in the presence of 6SG. These results indicate that some of the cytotoxic activity of 6SG may be due to disruption of the quadruplex structures formed by telomere and other DNAs. This additional mode of action is consistent with the delayed onset of cytotoxicity."
1059,1999,"A 2,2""-bipyridine ligand for incorporation into oligodeoxynucleotides: synthesis, stability and fluorescence properties of ruthenium-DNA complexes.","A non-nucleoside linker based upon the ligand 2,2'-bipyridine and ethylene glycol is prepared and placed into the backbone of a number of oligonucleo-tides. The bipyridine ligand is reacted with cis -dichloro bis(2,2'-bipyridyl) Ru(II) to generate the relatively substitutionally inert complex based upon the well-characterized tris -2,2'-bipyridyl Ru(II). The ruthenium-containing DNA complexes exhibited UV and fluorescence characteristics that are consistent with those previously observed for simple tris -2,2'-bipyridyl Ru(II) complexes. Oligonucleotides containing the ruthenium complex will form both DNA duplexes and triplexes with stabilities that are slightly better than those formed from simple tethered oligonucleotide probes in which the two hybridizing sequences are tethered by simple tri(ethylene glycol) or hexa(ethylene glycol) linkers."

Thus, celiac disease may present as a pellagra-like syndrome in the elderly with predominant weight loss that is enhanced by the related taste disturbances."

1063,1999,Abdominal compartment syndrome,
1064,1999,Abdominal compartment syndrome: does intra-cystic pressure reflect actual intra-abdominal pressure? A prospective study in surgical patients,"Background:Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as the adverse physiologic effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure. Prolonged, unrelieved pressure may lead to respiratory compromise, renal impairment, cardiac failure, shock, and death. Abdominal compartment syndrome is diagnosed by measuring intra-cystic pressure as a reflection of intra-abdominal pressure. To examine the validity of the technique, we conducted a prospective study in surgical patients by directly measuring bladder and abdominal pressures simultaneously during laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a previously described technique.Results:In the present model, the bladder had higher baseline pressures than did the abdomen. Measurements across the bladder wall were not identical, but had high positive correlation coefficient when evaluated on an individual basis. Global analysis of the data for all patients showed a weak correlation coefficient.Conclusion:In the present study model, intra-cystic pressure did not reflect actual intra-abdominal pressure. In spite of some limitations in the study design, we feel that further research is warranted to identify other possible variables that may play a role in the relationship between the urinary bladder and the abdominal cavity pressures, providing better means for diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome."
1065,1999,A bipartite sequence element associated with matrix/scaffold attachment regions.,"We have identified a MAR/SAR recognition signature (MRS) which is common to a large group of matrix and scaffold attachment regions. The MRS is composed of two degenerate sequences (AATAAYAA and AWWRTAANNWWGNNNC) within close proximity. Analysis of &gt;300 kb of genomic sequence from a variety of eukaryotic organisms shows that the MRS faithfully predicts 80% of MARs and SARs. In each case where we find a MRS, the corresponding DNA region binds specifically to the nuclear scaffold. Although all MRSs are associated with a SAR, not all known SARs and MARs contain a MRS, suggesting that at least two classes exist, one containing a MRS, the other not. Evidence is presented that the two sequence elements of the bipartite MRS occupy a position on the nucleosome near the dyad axis, together creating a putative protein binding site. The identification of a MAR- and SAR-associated DNA element is an important step forward towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of these elements. It will allow: (i) analysis of the genomic location of SARs, e.g. in relationship to genes, based on sequence information alone, rather than on the basis of an elaborate biochemical assay; (ii) identification and analysis of proteins that specifically bind to the MRS."
1066,1999,Abraham Flexner and the development of the Yale School of Medicine.,"Abraham Flexner first toured the Yale University School of Medicine in preparation for his report of 1910, but it was just the beginning of his relationship with the school. While his review of Yale in his report was generally favorable, he mentioned several shortfalls that needed to be improved to make the school acceptable. Throughout the next twenty-five years, Flexner worked with Deans George Blumer and Milton C. Winternitz to improve the school's finances, infrastructure, and quality of education through his work with the Carnegie Foundation and General Education Board Flexner has been given great accolades for his work on medical education for the country, but little mention is made of him at Yale, even though he was one of the most influential figures in the development of Yale in the last century.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 4"

1072,1999,A case-crossover analysis of air pollution and mortality in Philadelphia.,"This study reassessed Schwartz and Dockery's analysis of daily mortality from nonexternal causes among residents of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, over 8 years, from 1973 to 1980 [American Review of Respiratory Disease 145:600-604 (1992)]. A Poisson regression analysis using the same model found that a 100-microg/m(3) increment in the 48-hr mean concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) was associated with increased all-cause mortality [rate ratio = 1.069; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.043-1.096) after adjustment for quadratic trend, season, year, previous day's mean temperature, dew point, winter temperature, and indicators of hot (temperature &gt; 80 degrees F) and humid days (dew point &gt; 66 degrees F). Critics suggested that time-varying factors such as season and day of week were not sufficiently controlled in this analysis and subsequent studies in other locations. We used a conditional logistic regression analysis with a case-crossover design to reanalyze the data, with air pollution in the prior and subsequent weeks to the day of death serving as referent periods. The case-crossover approach controls for season and day of week by design rather than modeling. We found that a 100-microg/m(3) increment in the 48-hr mean level of TSP was associated with increased all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.056; CI, 1.027-1.086) after adjustment for the same weather variables as above. Similar associations were observed for deaths in individuals over 65 years of age (OR = 1.074; CI, 1. 037-1.111) and for deaths due to cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.063; CI, 1.021-1.107). The current case-crossover analysis confirms the general conclusion of the previous Poisson regression analysis of an association of TSP with daily mortality in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
1073,1999,A Case of Endobronchial Lipoma,"Endobronchial lipomas are very rare tumors originating from the tracheo-bronchial wall. We have experienced a case of endobronchial lipoma which was found at the orifice of the left lower lobe bronchus and obstructive pneumonia distal to it. Left lower lobectomy was performed, and the patient has been well without any symptoms so far. Endobronchial lipomas are histologically benign tumors, but more than half of the reported cases underwent lobectomy or pneumonectomy due to the presence of varying degrees of irreversible peripheral lung damages."

1075,1999,Accurate selection of a 5' splice site requires sequences within fibronectin alternative exon B.,"Inclusion of fibronectin alternative exon B in mRNA is developmentally regulated. Here we demonstrate that exon B contains two unique purine-rich sequence tracts, PRE1 and PRE2, that are important for proper 5' splice site selection both in vivo and in vitro. Targeted mutations of both PREs decreased the inclusion of exon B in the mRNA by 50% in vivo. Deletion or mutation of the PREs reduced removal of the downstream intron, but not the upstream intron, and induced the activation of cryptic 5' splice sites in vitro. PRE-mediated 5' splice selection activity appears sensitive to position and sequence context. A well characterized exon sequence enhancer that normally acts on the upstream 3' splice site can partially rescue proper exon B 5' splice site selection. In addition, we found that PRE 5' splice selection activity was preserved when exon B was inserted into a heterologous pre-mRNA substrate. Possible roles of these unique activities in modulating exon B splicing are considered."
1076,1999,A chicken embryo protein related to the mammalian DEAD box protein p68 is tightly associated with the highly purified protein-RNA complex of 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase.,"We have shown previously that DNA demethylation by chick embryo 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC)-DNA glycosylase needs both protein and RNA. Amino acid sequences of nine peptides derived from a highly purified 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase complex were identified by Nanoelectrospray ionisation mass spectrometry to be identical to the mammalian nuclear DEAD box protein p68 RNA helicase. Antibodies directed against human p68 helicase cross-reacted with the purified 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase complex and immunoprecipitated the glycosylase activity. A 2690 bp cDNA coding for the chicken homologue of mammalian p68 was isolated and sequenced. Its derived amino acid sequence is almost identical to the human p68 DEAD box protein up to amino acid position 473 (from a total of 595). This sequence contains all the essential conserved motifs from the DEAD box proteins which are the ATPase, RNA unwinding and RNA binding motifs. The rest of the 122 amino acids in the C-terminal region rather diverge from the human p68 RNA helicase sequence. The recombinant chicken DEAD box protein expressed in Escherichia coli cross-reacts with the same p68 antibodies as the purified chicken embryo 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase complex. The recombinant protein has an RNA-dependent ATPase and an ATP-dependent helicase activity. However, in the presence or absence of RNA the recombinant protein had no 5-MeC-DNA glycosylase activity. In situ hybridisation of 5 day-old chicken embryos with antisense probes of the chicken DEAD box protein shows a high abundance of its transcripts in differentiating embryonic tissues."

The sites were validated by: (i) standard cleaning procedures such as requiring consistency in the annotation of the gene structural elements, completeness of the coding regions and elimination of redundant sequences; (ii) clustering by decision trees coupled with analysis of ClustalW alignments of the translated protein sequence with homologous proteins from SWISS-PROT; (iii) matching against human EST sequences. The sites are categorised as: (i) donor sites, a set of 619 EST-confirmed donor sites, for which 138 are either the sites or the regions around the sites involved in alternative splice events; (ii) acceptor sites, a set of 623 EST-confirmed acceptor sites, for which 144 are either the sites or the regions around the sites are involved in alternative splice events; (iii) genuine splice sites, a set of 392 splice sites wherein both the donor and acceptor sites had EST confirmation and were not involved in any alternative splicing; (iv) alternative splice sites, a set of 209 splice sites wherein both the donor and acceptor sites had EST confirmation and the sites or the regions around them were involved in alternative splicing. A set of nucleotide regions that can be used to generate a control set of false splice sites that have a high confidence of being non-functional are also reported."
1080,1999,"A comparison of the reproductive physiology of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, collected from the Escambia and Blackwater Rivers in Florida.","Largemouth bass (LMB), Micropterus salmoides, were taken from the Escambia River (contaminated site) and the Blackwater River (reference site) near Pensacola, Florida. The Escambia River collection occurred downstream of the effluent from two identified point sources of pollution. These point sources included a coal-fired electric power plant and a chemical company. Conversely, the Blackwater River's headwaters and most of its length flow within a state park. Although there is some development on the lower part of the Blackwater River, fish were collected in the more pristine upper regions. Fish were captured by electroshocking and were maintained in aerated coolers. Physical measurements were obtained, blood was taken, and liver and gonads were removed. LMB plasma was assayed for the concentration of 17ss-estradiol (E2) and testosterone using validated radioimmunoassays. The presence of vitellogenin was determined by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody validated for largemouth bass vitellogenin. No differences in plasma concentrations of E2 or testosterone were observed in females from the two sites. Similarly, males exhibited no difference in plasma E2. However, plasma testosterone was lower in the males from the contaminated site, as compared to the reference site. Vitellogenic males occurred only at the contaminated site. Additionally, liver mass was proportionately higher in males from the contaminated site, as compared to males from the reference site. These data suggest that reproductive steroid levels may have been altered by increased hepatic enzyme activity, and the presence of vitellogenic males indicates that an exogenous source of estrogen was present in the Escambia River.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5Figure 6"
1081,1999,A comprehensive comparison of multiple sequence alignment programs.,"In recent years improvements to existing programs and the introduction of new iterative algorithms have changed the state-of-the-art in protein sequence alignment. This paper presents the first systematic study of the most commonly used alignment programs using BAliBASE benchmark alignments as test cases. Even below the 'twilight zone' at 10-20% residue identity, the best programs were capable of correctly aligning on average 47% of the residues. We show that iterative algorithms often offer improved alignment accuracy though at the expense of computation time. A notable exception was the effect of introducing a single divergent sequence into a set of closely related sequences, causing the iteration to diverge away from the best alignment. Global alignment programs generally performed better than local methods, except in the presence of large N/C-terminal extensions and internal insertions. In these cases, a local algorithm was more successful in identifying the most conserved motifs. This study enables us to propose appropriate alignment strategies, depending on the nature of a particular set of sequences. The employment of more than one program based on different alignment techniques should significantly improve the quality of automatic protein sequence alignment methods. The results also indicate guidelines for improvement of alignment algorithms."
1082,1999,A comprehensive database for the small nucleolar RNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in cleavage of rRNA, modification of rRNA nucleotides and, perhaps, other aspects of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. Scores of snoRNAs have been discovered in recent years from various eukaryotes, and the total number is predicted to be up to 200 different snoRNA species per individual organism. We have created a comprehensive database for snoRNAs from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which allows easy access to detailed information about each species known (almost 70 snoRNAs are featured). The database consists of three major parts: (i) a utilities section; (ii) a master table; and (iii) a collection of tables for the individual snoRNAs. The utilities section provides an introduction to the database. The master table lists all known S. cerevisiae snoRNAs and their major properties. Information in the individual tables includes: alternate names, size, family classification, genomic organization, sequences (with major features identified), GenBank accession numbers, occurrence of homologues, gene disruption phenotypes, functional properties and associated RNAs and proteins. All information is accompanied with appropriate literature references. The database is available on the World Wide Web (http://www.bio.umass. edu/biochem/rna-sequence/Yeast_snoRNA_Database/snoRNA_ DataBase.html), and should be useful for a wide range of snoRNA studies."
1083,1999,A computer-controlled multi-electrode switch,"A computer-actuated switch was built to control, simultaneously, two automatic titration assemblies each consisting of an electrode pair and a burette, and using only one measuring device. This switch is modular, simple and versatile allowing easy adaptation and expansion; apart from its application in multiple-titration systems, this device can also be used for standard addition analysis and multi-component analysis using ion-selective electrodes (ISE). The repeatability as well as the accuracy of the measurements made with this switch were ensured using high-quality relays, and very high electrical insulation, attained through the use of two separate printed circuit boards (pcb) of good quality and careful design of these pcbs. This low-cost multi-electrode switch is controlled through the parallel port of a PC that collects the data via an inexpensive 12-bit ADC board (8-bit ISA type), and is easily programmable in any high-level language. This type of device allows the collection of a large amount of data in relatively short periods, which can be analysed later allowing the choice of the best compromise of time versus accuracy for the study of any particular system."
1084,1999,A conditional U5 snRNA mutation affecting pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear pre-mRNA retention identifies SSD1/SRK1 as a general splicing mutant suppressor.,"A combination of point mutations disrupting both stem 1 and stem 2 of U5 snRNA (U5AI) was found to confer a thermosensitive phenotype in vivo. In a strain expressing U5AI, pre-mRNA splicing was blocked before the first step through an inability of the mutant U5 snRNA to efficiently associate with the U4/U6 di-snRNP. Formation of early splicing complexes was not affected in extracts prepared from U5 snRNA mutant cells, while the capacity of these extracts to splice a pre-mRNA in vitro was greatly diminished. In addition, significant levels of a translation product derived from intron containing pre-mRNAs could be detected in vivo. The SSD1/SRK1 gene was identified as a multi-copy suppressor of the U5AI snRNA mutant. Single copy expression of SSD1/SRK1 was sufficient to suppress the thermosensitive phenotype, and high copy expression partially suppressed the splicing and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP assembly pheno-types. SSD1/SRK1 also suppressed thermosensitive mutations in the Prp18p and U1-70K proteins, while inhibiting growth of the cold sensitive U1-4U snRNA mutant at 30 degrees C. Thus we have identified SSD1/SRK1 as a general suppressor of splicing mutants."
1085,1999,A conserved bulged adenosine in a peripheral duplex of the antigenomic HDV self-cleaving RNA reduceskinetic trapping of inactive conformations.,"In the ribozyme of hepatitis delta virus antigenomic RNA, two short duplexes, P2 and P2a, stabilize the active self-cleaving structure. However, P2a also promotes kinetic trapping of non-native structures. A bulged adenosine (A14) separates P2a and P2; this bulged A is conserved in clinical isolates of HDV but is unlikely to be physically close to the cleavage site phosphate in the ribozyme structure. Removing the bulge did not significantly slow the rate of cleavage but slowed the conversion of inactive to active conformations. In the absence of the bulged A, inactive conformations required higher urea concentrations or higher temperatures to be activated. Thus, the bulged-nucleotide in the P2-P2a duplex did not provide an essential kink or hinge between P2 and P2a that was required for cleavage activity but, rather, increased the rate of refolding from an inactive to an active ribozyme structure. These data also suggest a model in which P2 and P2a form a coaxial stacked helix of 9 bp, the most likely arrangement being one in which P2-P2a is roughly parallel to P1."
1086,1999,A conserved motif in group IC3 introns is a new class of GNRA receptor.,"Terminal tetraloops consisting of GNRA sequences are often found in biologically active large RNAs. The loops appear to contribute towards the organization of higher order RNA structures by forming specific tertiary interactions with their receptors. Group IC3 introns which possess a GAAA loop in the L2 region often have a phylogenetically conserved motif in their P8 domains. In this report, we show that this conserved motif stands as a new class of receptor that distinguishes the sequences of GNRA loops less stringently than previously known receptors. The motif can functionally substitute an 11 nt motif receptor in the Tetrahymena ribozyme. Its structural and functional similarity to one class of synthetic receptors obtained from in vitro selection is observed."
1087,1999,A conserved motif N-terminal to the DNA-binding domains of myogenic bHLH transcription factors mediates cooperative DNA binding with pbx-Meis1/Prep1.,"The t(1;19) chromosomal translocation of pediatric pre-B cell leukemia produces chimeric oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1, which contains the N-terminal transactivation domain of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, E2a, joined to the majority of the homeodomain protein, Pbx1. There are three Pbx family members, which bind DNA as heterodimers with both broadly expressed Meis/Prep1 homeo-domain proteins and specifically expressed Hox homeodomain proteins. These Pbx heterodimers can augment the function of transcriptional activators bound to adjacent elements. In heterodimers, a conserved tryptophan motif in Hox proteins binds a pocket on the surface of the Pbx homeodomain, while Meis/Prep1 proteins bind an N-terminal Pbx domain, raising the possibility that the tryptophan-interaction pocket of the Pbx component of a Pbx-Meis/Prep1 complex is still available to bind trypto-phan motifs of other transcription factors bound to flanking elements. Here, we report that Pbx-Meis1/Prep1 binds DNA cooperatively with heterodimers of E2a and MyoD, myogenin, Mrf-4 or Myf-5. As with Hox proteins, a highly conserved tryptophan motif N-terminal to the DNA-binding domains of each myogenic bHLH family protein is required for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx-Meis1/Prep1. In vivo, MyoD requires this tryptophan motif to evoke chromatin remodeling in the Myogenin promoter and to activate Myogenin transcription. Pbx-Meis/Prep1 complexes, therefore, have the potential to cooperate with the myogenic bHLH proteins in regulating gene transcription."
1088,1999,A critical review of epidemiologic studies of radiofrequency exposure and human cancers.,"This paper reviews studies that have assessed associations between likely exposure to radiofrequency (RF) transmissions and various types of human cancer. These studies include three cluster investigations and five studies relating to general populations; all of these studies consider place of residence at the time of cancer diagnosis in regard to proximity to radio or television transmitters. There are also five relevant occupational cohort studies and several case-control studies of particular types of cancer. These studies assessed a large number of possible associations. Several positive associations suggesting an increased risk of some types of cancer in those who may have had greater exposure to RF emissions have been reported. However, the results are inconsistent: there is no type of cancer that has been consistently associated with RF exposures. The epidemiologic evidence falls short of the strength and consistency of evidence that is required to come to a reasonable conclusion that RF emissions are a likely cause of one or more types of human cancer. The evidence is weak in regard to its inconsistency, the design of the studies, the lack of detail on actual exposures, and the limitations of the studies in their ability to deal with other likely relevant factors. In some studies there may be biases in the data used"
1089,1999,Activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by nerve growth factor is mediated by the p42/p44 MAPK cascade.,The Bcl-2 protein has an anti-apoptotic effect in neuronal and other cell types. We show for the first time that the Bcl-2 promoter is activated by the neuronal survival factor nerve growth factor (NGF) and that this effect is dependent on a region of the promoter from -1472 to -1414. This activation requires the Rap-1 G protein and the MEK-1 and p42/p44 MAPK enzymes but is independent of other NGF-activated signalling pathways involving protein kinase A or protein kinase C.
1090,1999,Activity of recombinant HIV-1 integrase on mini-HIV DNA.,"Integration of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cDNA into the genome of a human cell is an essential step in the viral replication cycle. Understanding of the integration process has been facilitated by the development of in vitro assays using specific oligonucleotides and recombinant integrase. However, understanding of the biology of retroviral integration will require in vitro and in vivo model systems using long DNA substrates that mimic the HIV cDNA. We have now studied the activity of recombinant HIV-1 integrase on a linear 4.7 kb double-stranded DNA, containing flanking regions of approximately 200 bp that represent the intact ends of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences (mini-HIV). The strand transfer products of the integration reaction can be directly visualized after separation in agarose gels by ethidium bromide staining. The most prominent reaction product resulted from integration of one LTR end into another LTR end (U5 into U5 and U5 into U3). Sequence analysis of the reaction products showed them to be products of legitimate integration preceded by correct processing of the viral LTR ends. Hotspots for integration were detected. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of a range of reaction products resulting from single or multiple integration events. The binding of HIV-1 integrase to mini-HIV DNA was visualized. Oligomers of integrase seem to induce DNA looping whereby the enzyme often appears to be bound to the DNA substrate that adopts the structure of a three-site synapsis that is reminiscent of the Mu phage transposase complex."
1091,1999,Acute effects of inhalable particles on the frog palate mucociliary epithelium.,"This work was designed to evaluate the toxicity of inhalable particles [less than/equal to] 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)) collected from the urban air in SÌ£o Paulo, Brazil, to the mucociliary apparatus using the frog palate preparation. Seven groups of frog palates were immersed in different concentrations of PM(10) diluted in Ringer's solution during 120 min: 0 (control, n = 31); 50 (n = 10); 100 (n = 9); 500 (n = 28); 1,000 (n = 10); 5,000 (n = 11); and 10,000 microg/m(3) (n = 10). Mucociliary transport and transepithelial potential difference were determined at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min exposure. Additional groups (control and 500 microg/m(3)) were studied by means of morphometric analyses (quantification of the amount of intraepithelial and surface mucins), measurement of cilia beat frequency, and quantification of total glutathione. Mucociliary transport and transepithelial potential difference were significantly decreased at higher concentrations of PM(10) (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). Exposure to PM(10) also elicited a significant decrease of total glutathione (p = 0. 003) and depletion of neutral intraepithelial mucins (p = 0.0461). These results show that PM(10) can promote significant alterations in ciliated epithelium in vitro.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2"
1092,1999,Acute gastrointestinal effects of graded levels of copper in drinking water.,"The objective of this study was to determine the acute gastrointestinal effects caused by the consumption of drinking water containing graded levels of added copper. Sixty healthy, adult women were randomly assigned to receive copper [Cu(II)] at four concentrations in their drinking water following a Latin-square design. Each group (n = 15) received tap water with no added copper, 1, 3, and 5 mg Cu/l of added copper sulfate for a 2-week study period, followed by 1 week of standard tap water. The subjects recorded their water consumption and gastrointestinal symptoms daily on a special form. The average daily consumption of water was 1.64 liters per subject, regardless of the amount of copper added. Final serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and liver enzymes were measured in all subjects and were not different from baseline concentrations. Twenty-one subjects (35%) recorded gastrointestinal disturbances sometime during the study, 9 had diarrhea, some with abdominal pain and vomiting, and 12 subjects presented abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. There was no association between copper levels in drinking water and diarrhea. However, nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting were significantly related to copper concentrations in water. The recorded incidence rate of these symptoms was 5, 2, 17, and 15% while ingesting water with 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg Cu/l, respectively (overall [chi]2 = 11.3, p&lt;0.01; Cu [less than/equal to]1 mg/l versus Cu [Greater than/equal to]3 mg/l, [chi]2, p&lt;0.01). When subjects interrupted their consumption of drinking water with added copper, most symptoms disappeared. We conclude that under the conditions of the study, there was no association between aggregate copper in drinking water within the range of 0-5 mg/l and diarrhea, but a [Greater than/equal to]3 mg Cu/l level of ionized copper was associated with nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting. Additional studies with sufficient numbers of subjects are needed to define thresholds for specific gastrointestinal symptoms with precision and to extrapolate these results to the population at large.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2"

1095,1999,"Adenines at -11, -9 and -8 play a key role in the binding of Bacillus subtilis Esigma(A) RNA polymerase to -10 region single-stranded DNA.","The sigma subunit of RNA polymerase interacts with the promoter DNA in at least two regions: the -35 and the -10 consensus elements. The latter contacts are involved both in recognition and in melting of the promoter DNA to form the transcriptionally-competent open complex. RNA polymerase holoenzyme, but neither core nor sigma alone, binds with high selectivity to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) containing the non-template -10 consensus sequence. We have used equilibrium competition to assess the specificity of holoenzyme binding to a 19 base oligonucleotide containing a -10 consensus element, TATAAT. Analysis of all 18 possible single point mutations in the -10 consensus sequence reveals that binding by Bacillus subtilis Esigma(A)holoenzyme depends critically upon adenine at position -11 and, unexpectedly, is strongly affected by substitutions of the poorly conserved adenines at -9 and -8. Similarly, ssDNA binding by Escherichia coli Esigma(70)holoenzyme is most strongly affected by substitutions of adenines within the -10 region consensus. The critical role of -11A in binding ssDNA supports a key role for this base in the nucleation of DNA melting. A novel role for -9A and -8A is proposed in the context of recent models of promoter melting."
1096,1999,Adenoma of the Ampulla of Vater: A Genetic Condition?,The etiology of adenoma of the ampulla of Vater is not well understood. Previous authors reported the association of this neoplasm with polycystic kidney disease of two fraternal sisters. They concluded that these two conditions were somehow related. We describe a case of ampullary adenoma associated with polycystic kidney disease. This presentation raises again the question of a possible link between these two diseases.
1097,1999,A detailed study of the substrate specificity of a chimeric restriction enzyme.,"Recently, the crystal structure of the designed zinc finger protein, DeltaQNK, bound to a preferred DNA sequence was reported. We have converted DeltaQNK into a novel site-specific endonuclease by linking it to the Fok I cleavage domain (FN). The substrate specificity and DNA cleavage properties of the resulting chimeric restriction enzyme (DeltaQNK-FN) were investigated, and the binding affinities of DeltaQNK and DeltaQNK-FN for various DNA substrates were determined. Substrates that are bound by DeltaQNK with high affinity are the same as those that are cleaved efficiently by DeltaQNK-FN. Substrates bound by DeltaQNK with lower affinity are cleaved with very low efficiency or not at all by DeltaQNK-FN. The binding of DeltaQNK-FN to each substrate was approximately 2-fold weaker than that for DeltaQNK. Thus, the fusion of the Fok I cleavage domain to the zinc finger motif does not change the DNA sequence specificity of the zinc finger protein and does not change its binding affinity significantly."
1098,1999,A Developmental Bias in Reading Frame Usage by Human Fetal Thymic TCRBDJ Transcripts is not Present in Genomic TCRBDJ Rearrangements,"We have previously reported that reading-frame usage and functional diversification is developmentally regulated, with virtually all TCRB DJ mRNA transcripts using a single reading frame at 8 weeks of gestational age, tapering to 50% by adult life. We used the polymerase chain reaction to create genomic libraries of DJ rearrangements in the TCRB locus from thymuses at 7.7, 10, and 16 weeks of gestational age, and from adult thymuses. Clones were randomly picked and sequenced to determine junctional sequences and reading-frame utilization. The resulting data address the hypothesis that cells bearing genomic joints in reading frame one are preferentially selected during fetal life. This hypothesis predicts that reading- frame bias would also be observed among genomic DJ joints. Instead, we observed random utilization of the three possible D-region reading frames among genomic D1s1 =&gt; J1s1 joints during fetal life. Similar results were obtained at 7.7 weeks of gestational age in a second thymus in which both RNA and DNA were simultaneously isolated and used to create libraries of TCRBDJ transcripts or rearrangements. We conclude that reading-frame utilization is random among genomic D1s1-JB1s1 rearrangements and that the preferential usage of a single reading frame among mRNA transcripts of TCRB DJ transcripts is the result of preferential transcription of genomic TCRB DJ joints in a single reading frame, or that TCRB DJ transcripts have a longer half-life than transcripts in reading frames two or three."
1099,1999,A dimer of the lymphoid protein RAG1 recognizes the recombination signal sequence and the complex stably incorporates the high mobility group protein HMG2.,"RAG1 and RAG2 are the two lymphoid-specific proteins required for the cleavage of DNA sequences known as the recombination signal sequences (RSSs) flanking V, D or J regions of the antigen-binding genes. Previous studies have shown that RAG1 alone is capable of binding to the RSS, whereas RAG2 only binds as a RAG1/RAG2 complex. We have expressed recombinant core RAG1 (amino acids 384-1008) in Escherichia coli and demonstrated catalytic activity when combined with RAG2. This protein was then used to determine its oligomeric forms and the dissociation constant of binding to the RSS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that up to three oligomeric complexes of core RAG1 form with a single RSS. Core RAG1 was found to exist as a dimer both when free in solution and as the minimal species bound to the RSS. Competition assays show that RAG1 recognizes both the conserved nonamer and heptamer sequences of the RSS. Zinc analysis shows the core to contain two zinc ions. The purified RAG1 protein overexpressed in E.coli exhibited the expected cleavage activity when combined with RAG2 purified from transfected 293T cells. The high mobility group protein HMG2 is stably incorporated into the recombinant RAG1/RSS complex and can increase the affinity of RAG1 for the RSS in the absence of RAG2."
1100,1999,A DNA polymerase stop assay for G-quadruplex-interactive compounds.,"We have developed and characterized an assay for G-quadruplex-interactive compounds that makes use of the fact that G-rich DNA templates present obstacles to DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases. Using Taq DNA polymerase and the G-quadruplex binding 2, 6-diamidoanthraquinone BSU-1051, we find that BSU-1051 leads to enhanced arrest of DNA synthesis in the presence of K+by stabilizing an intramolecular G-quadruplex structure formed by four repeats of either TTGGGG or TTAGGG in the template strand. The data provide additional evidence that BSU-1051 modulates telomerase activity by stabilization of telomeric G-quadruplex DNA and point to a polymerase arrest assay as a sensitive method for screening for G-quadruplex-interactive agents with potential clinical utility."

1105,2000,2‰Û_-Deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-ë_-d-arabinonucleosides and oligonucleotides (2‰Û_F-ANA): synthesis and physicochemical studies,"Recently, hybrids of RNA and d-arabinonucleic acids (ANA) as well as the 2‰Û_-deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-d-arabinonucleic acid analog (2‰Û_F-ANA) were shown to be substrates of RNase H. This enzyme is believed to be involved in the primary mechanism by which antisense oligonucleotides cause a reduction in target RNA levels in vivo. To gain a better understanding of the properties of arabinose based oligonucleotides, we have prepared a series of 2‰Û_F-ANA sequences of homopolymeric (A and T) and mixed base composition (A, T, G and C). UV thermal melting and circular dichroic (CD) studies were used to ascertain the thermodynamic stability and helical conformation of 2‰Û_F-ANA/RNA and 2‰Û_F-ANA/DNA hybrids. It is shown that 2‰Û_F-ANA has enhanced RNA affinity relative to that of DNA and phosphorothioate DNA. The 2‰Û_-fluoroarabino modification showed favorable pairing to single-stranded DNA also. This is in sharp contrast to ANA, which forms weak ANA/DNA hybrids at best. According to the measured thermodynamic parameters for duplex formation, the increased stability of hybrids formed by 2‰Û_F-ANA (e.g., 2‰Û_F-ANA/RNA) appears to originate from conformational pre-organization of the fluorinated sugars and a favorable enthalpy of hybridization. In addition, NMR spectroscopy revealed a five-bond coupling between the 2‰Û_F and the base protons (H6/H8) of 2‰Û_-deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-ë_-d-arabinonucleosides. This observation is suggestive of a through-space interaction between 2‰Û_F and H6/H8 atoms. CD experiments indicate that 2‰Û_F-ANA/RNA hybrids adopt an ‰Û÷A-like‰Ûª structure and show more resemblance to DNA/RNA hybrids than to the pure RNA/RNA duplex. This feature is believed to be an important factor in the mechanism that allows RNase H to discriminate between 2‰Û_F-ANA/RNA (or DNA/RNA) and RNA/RNA duplexes."
1106,2000,2-Hydroxy-dATP is incorporated opposite G by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III resulting in high mutagenicity,"Four kinds of oxidatively damaged DNA precursors, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine 5‰Û_-triphosphate (8-OH-dGTP), 2-hydroxydeoxyadenosine 5‰Û_-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP), 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine 5‰Û_-triphosphate (5-OH-dCTP) and 5-formyldeoxyuridine 5‰Û_-triphosphate (5-CHO-dUTP), were employed in in vitro gap-filling reactions of the supF gene conducted by the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and these treated DNAs were transfected into various E.coli strains. When the manipulated DNAs were transfected into the repair-proficient strain, supF mutants were obtained much more frequently by the purine nucleotides than by the pyrimidine nucleotides (2-OH-dATP &gt; 8-OH-dGTP &gt;&gt; 5-OH-dCTP ~ 5-CHO-dUTP). This result is in contrast to our previous observation that these four oxidatively damaged nucleotides induce chromosomal gene mutations with similar frequencies when incorporated directly into E.coli. 2-OH-dATP elicited G‰ ÕT transversions, indicating the formation of G‰Û¢2-OH-dATP pairs. These results demonstrate that 2-OH-dATP was highly mutagenic in this assay system containing the in vitro DNA synthesis by the E.coli replicative DNA polymerase, in addition to in the in vivo assay system reported previously. Slight increases in the mutant frequencies were observed when alkA (for 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP) and mutY (for 2-OH-dATP) strains were used as hosts. This is the first report that clearly shows the formation of G‰Û¢2-OH-dATP pairs."
1107,2000,3‰Û_-Minor groove binder-DNA probes increase sequence specificity at PCR extension temperatures,"DNA probes with conjugated minor groove binder (MGB) groups form extremely stable duplexes with single-stranded DNA targets, allowing shorter probes to be used for hybridization based assays. In this paper, sequence specificity of 3‰Û_-MGB probes was explored. In comparison with unmodified DNA, MGB probes had higher melting temperature (Tm) and increased specificity, especially when a mismatch was in the MGB region of the duplex. To exploit these properties, fluorogenic MGB probes were prepared and investigated in the 5‰Û_-nuclease PCR assay (real-time PCR assay, TaqMan assay). A 12mer MGB probe had the same Tm (65å¡C) as a no-MGB 27mer probe. The fluorogenic MGB probes were more specific for single base mismatches and fluorescence quenching was more efficient, giving increased sensitivity. A/T rich duplexes were stabilized more than G/C rich duplexes, thereby leveling probe Tm and simplifying design. In summary, MGB probes were more sequence specific than standard DNA probes, especially for single base mismatches at elevated hybridization temperatures."
1108,2000,4-amino-1H-benzo[g]quinazoline-2-one: a fluorescent analog of cytosine to probe protonation sites in triplex forming oligonucleotides,"We developed a new fluorescent analog of cytosine, the 4-amino-1H-benzo[g]quinazoline-2-one, which constitute a probe sensitive to pH. The 2‰Û_-O-Me ribonucleoside derivative of this heterocycle was synthesized and exhibited a fluorescence emission centered at 456 nm, characterized by four major excitation maxima (250, 300, 320 and 370 nm) and a fluorescence quantum yield of ë_ = 0.62 at pH 7.1. The fluorescence emission maximum shifted from 456 to 492 nm when pH was decreased from 7.1 to 2.1. The pKa (4) was close to that of cytosine (4.17). When introduced in triplex forming oligonucleotides this new nucleoside can be used to reveal the protonation state of triplets in triple-stranded structures. Complex formation was detected by a significant quenching of fluorescence emission (‰ö_88%) and the N-3 protonation of the quinazoline ring by a shift of the emission maximum from 485 to 465 nm. Using this probe we unambiguously showed that triplex formation of the pyrimidine motif does not require the protonation of all 4-amino-2-one pyrimidine rings."
1109,2000,"4-Aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4-APP) as a novel inhibitor of the RNA and DNA depurination induced by Shiga toxin 1","Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) catalyses the removal of a unique and specific adenine from 28S RNA in ribosomes (RNA-N-glycosidase activity) and the release of multiple adenines from DNA (DNA glycosylase activity). Added adenine behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of the RNA-N-glycosidase reaction binding more tightly to the Stx1‰ÛÒribosome complex than to the free enzyme. Several purine derivatives and analogues have now been assayed as inhibitors of Stx1. Most of the compounds showed only minor differences in the rank order of activity on the two enzymatic reactions catalysed by Stx1. The survey highlights the importance of the amino group in the 6-position of the pyrimidine ring of adenine. Shifting (2-aminopurine) or substituting (hypoxanthine, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-methylpurine) the group greatly decreases the inhibitory power. The presence of a second ring, besides the pyrimidine one, is strictly required. Substitution, by introducing an additional nitrogen, of the imidazole ring of adenine with triazole leads to loss of inhibitory power, while rearrangement of the nitrogen atoms of the ring from the imidazole to the pyrazole configuration greatly enhances the inhibitory power. Thus 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4-APP), the isomer of adenine with the five-membered ring in the pyrazole configuration, is by far the most potent inhibitor of both enzymatic reactions catalysed by Stx1. This finding opens perspectives on therapeutic strategies to protect endothelial renal cells once endocytosis of Stx1 has occurred (haemolytic uraemic syndrome). In the RNA-N-glycosidase reaction 4-APP binds, as adenine, predominantly to the Stx1‰ÛÒribosome complex (uncompetitive inhibition), while inhibition of the DNA glycosylase activity by both inhibitors is of the mixed type."
1110,2000,50-Hertz magnetic field and calcium transients in Jurkat cells: results of a research and public information dissemination (RAPID) program study.,"An effect on intracellular calcium continues to be proposed as a biochemical pathway for the mediation of biologic effects of electrical-power-frequency magnetic fields (MF). However, reproducible results among laboratories are difficult to attain and the characteristics of magnetic field effects on intracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) are not well understood. We attempted to repeat the studies of LindstrÌ¦m et al. [Intracellular Calcium Oscillations in a T-Cell Line by a Weak 50 Hz Magnetic Field. J Cell Physiol 156:395-398 (1993)] by investigating the effect of a 1.5-G 50-Hz MF on [Ca(2+)](i) in the Jurkat lymphocyte T-cell line. Changes in [Ca(2+)](i) were determined using microscopic imaging of fura-2 loaded Jurkat cells on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. The MF was generated by a single coil constructed with bifilar wire and located in the same plane as the cells. Cells were randomly exposed for 8 min to MF, sham field (SF), or no field (NF) conditions. The exposure condition remained coded until data analysis was complete. Each exposure period was preceded by an 8-min data collection to establish a baseline for [Ca(2+)](i). After each exposure condition, cells were exposed to anti-CD3 antibody that induced a rapid increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in responsive cells; this provided a positive control. [Ca(2+)](i) was analyzed for individual cells as spatially-averaged background-corrected 340/380 nm ratios, and a [Ca(2+)](i) transient was considered significant for positive deviations from baseline of 3 [multiple] an estimate of noise in the baseline. Typically, 25-50 cells/field were viewed and approximately 50% had no [Ca(2+)](i) transients in the baseline period and also responded to positive control. Only cells responding to positive control and lacking changes in [Ca(2+)](i) during the baseline period were considered qualified for assessment during the exposure period. The incidences of [Ca(2+)](i) transients during the exposure period for two experiments (40 [multiple] objective) were 16.5, 14.6, and 14.2% for MF, SF, and NF, respectively, and were not statistically significantly different. Previous studies by LindstrÌ¦m et al. [Intracellular Calcium Oscillations in a T-Cell Line after Exposure to Extremely-Low-Frequency Magnetic Fields with Variable Frequencies and Flux Densities. Bioelectromagnetics 16:41-47 (1995)] showed a high response rate (92%) for exposure to 1. 5-G 50-Hz MF when individual cells were preselected for investigation. We found no such effect when examining many cells simultaneously in a random and blind fashion. These results do not preclude an effect of MF on [Ca(2+)](i), but suggest that responsive cells, if they exist, were not identified using the approaches that we used in this study.ImagesFigure 1Figure 2Figure 3"
1111,2000,5-Methylcytosine DNA glycosylase activity is also present in the human MBD4 (G/T mismatch glycosylase) and in a related avian sequence,"A 1468 bp cDNA coding for the chicken homolog of the human MBD4 G/T mismatch DNA glycosylase was isolated and sequenced. The derived amino acid sequence (416 amino acids) shows 46% identity with the human MBD4 and the conserved catalytic region at the C-terminal end (170 amino acids) has 90% identity. The non-conserved region of the avian protein has no consensus sequence for the methylated DNA binding domain. The recombinant proteins from human and chicken have G/T mismatch as well as 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) DNA glycosylase activities. When tested by gel shift assays, human recombinant protein with or without the methylated DNA binding domain binds equally well to symmetrically, hemimethylated DNA and non-methylated DNA. However, the enzyme has only 5-MeC DNA glycosylase activity with the hemimethylated DNA. Footprinting of human MBD4 and of an N-terminal deletion mutant with partially depurinated and depyrimidinated substrate reveal a selective binding of the proteins to the modified substrate around the CpG. As for 5-MeC DNA glycosylase purified from chicken embryos, MBD4 does not use oligonucleotides containing mCpA, mCpT or mCpC as substrates. An mCpG within an A+T-rich oligonucleotide is a much better substrate than an A+T-poor sequence. The Km of human MBD4 for hemimethylated DNA is ‰ö_10‰ÛÒ7 M with a Vmax of ‰ö_10‰ÛÒ11 mol/h/åµg protein. Deletion mutations show that G/T mismatch and 5-MeC DNA glycosylase are located in the C-terminal conserved region. In sharp contrast to the 5-MeC DNA glycosylase isolated from the chicken embryo DNA demethylation complex, the two enzymatic activities of MBD4 are strongly inhibited by RNA. In situ hybridization with antisense RNA indicate that MBD4 is only located in dividing cells of differentiating embryonic tissues."

1115,2000,A 37-year-old mechanic with multiple chemical sensitivities.,"A 37-year-old heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning mechanic developed respiratory, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system symptoms associated with a variety of odorous environmental chemicals. Organic disease was not evident, but the patient was distressed by these symptoms and was at risk for becoming disabled by them. His symptoms fit broadly into the condition recognized as multiple chemical sensitivity. Multiple chemical sensitivity is a diagnostic term for a group of symptoms without demonstrated organic basis. The symptoms are characteristic of dysfunction in multiple organ systems, they increase and decrease according to exposure to low levels of chemical agents in the patient's environment, and they sometimes occur after a distinct environmental change or insult such as an industrial accident or remodeling. Although traditional medical organizations have not agreed on a definition for this syndrome, it is being increasingly recognized and makes up an increasing percentage of the caseload at occupational and environmental medicine clinics. Although there is often dispute about whether the symptoms have a functional or organic basis, an informed approach to evaluation, diagnosis, and management and a careful assessment of impairment, disability, and work relatedness are necessary. Careful exclusion of organic causes is critical, and this should be followed by a judicious approach to coping with symptoms."
1116,2000,A 4-year-old girl with manifestations of multiple chemical sensitivities.,"Multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS) syndrome, also known as idiopathic environmental intolerance, is a controversial diagnosis that encompasses a wide range of waxing and waning, subjective symptoms referable to more than one body system and provoked by exposure to low levels of chemicals, foods, or other agents in the environment. Although MCS has been studied extensively, a unifying mechanism explaining the illness remains obscure, and clinicians are divided as to whether such a medical entity exists separately from psychosomatic syndromes. MCS is an adult diagnosis; there is little reference to pediatric cases in the scientific literature. In this case from the Pediatric Environmental Health Subspecialty Unit at Boston's Children's Hospital, I present the case of a preschool child who had suffered from milk allergy and poor weight gain as an infant, and then later developed asthma, allergic symptoms, sinusitis, headaches, fatigue, and rashes precipitated by an expanding variety of chemicals, foods, and allergens.

1119,2000,Aberrant Development of Thymocytes in Mice Lacking Laminin-2,"In previous in vitro studies, we proposed a role for the extracellular matrix component, laminin- 2, and its integrin receptor, VLA-6, in thymocyte development. The characterization of two dystrophic mouse strains with different defects in laminin-2 allowed us to examine this proposal in vivo. Mice deficient in laminin-2, dy/dy, show a significant reduction in thymus size and number of thymocytes compared to normal littermates. These mice also exhibited apparent alterations of thymic architecture. Examination of the CD4/CD8 populations in dy/dy thymi showed large relative increases in the DN (CD4-CD8-) and SP (CD4+CD8-, CD4-CD8+) populations and a significant decrease in the DP (CD4+CD8+) population. Further examination of the DN population for CD44 and CD25 expression showed a remarkable decrease in the more mature pre-T cell populations. Analysis of apoptosis in situ, and by flow cytometry, in dy/dy thymi revealed a significant increase in apoptotic DN thymocytes in the capsule and subcapsular regions. Interestingly, thymocyte development appeared to proceed normally in dystrophic mice expressing a mutant form of laminin-2, dy2J, as well as, in fetal and neonatal dy/dy mice. We propose that laminin-2 plays an active role in thymocyte development by delivering cell survival and differentiation signals at specific stages of development in young adult mice."

1122,2000,A CASE OF A PATHOGENIC ACTIVE SCAR,"Soft tissues follow every movement of bones and joints. Their free movement is essential for normal functioning of the motor system. Scars form mainly in the soft tissues, and if abnormal, or ‰Û÷active‰Ûª, can interfere with the function of the motor system as well. For diagnosis and treatment the barrier phenomenon is a most useful concept: a pathological barrier restricts movement and does not spring when engaged. After engaging the barrier and waiting, release, relief and normal mobility are obtained. An illustrative case with an active appendectomy scar is presented, with both low back and abdominal pain. Extensive and costly examination were all negative. After diagnosis and treatment of the active scar symptoms were promptly relieved. Diagnosis and treatment of active scars should become part of the physical therapist‰Ûªs approach to the patient‰Ûªs problems."

1124,2000,A catalytic antioxidant metalloporphyrin blocks hydrogen peroxide-induced mitochondrial DNA damage,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated as the cause of cumulative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids that can ultimately result in cell death. A common problem when measuring oxidative DNA damage has been the introduction of modifications in the native state of the molecule by many DNA isolation methods. We circumvented this problem by employing direct PCR (DPCR) of whole cell lysates. DPCR of mouse lung fibroblasts performed better than PCRs containing template acquired by phenol/chloroform extraction or a commercially available genomic DNA isolation kit. We investigated the direct use of whole cell preparations in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated DNA damage. We observed a concentration-dependent decrease in amplification efficiency of a 4.3 kb mitochondrial (mt)DNA target in H2O2-treated mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs). At low doses the efficiency of amplification returns to control levels over 24 h. We detected no change in amplification efficiency of a plasmid control containing our mtDNA target under any of the culture conditions employed in these studies. Treatment of MLFs with the catalytic antioxidant manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin (MnTBAP) attenuates the effects of H2O2 exposure. When quantitated with an external standard the use of DPCR in tandem with a PCR amplification efficiency assay provides a powerful approach to assess oxidative mtDNA damage."
1125,2000,Accessibility of transcriptionally inactive genes is specifically reduced at homeoprotein-DNA binding sites in Drosophila,"We showed previously that homeoproteins bind to multiple DNA sites throughout the length of most genes in Drosophila embryos. Based on a compariå_son of in vivo and in vitro DNA binding specificities, we suggested that homeoprotein binding sites on actively transcribed genes are largely accessible, whereas the binding of homeoproteins to inactive and poorly transcribed genes may be significantly inhibited at most sites, perhaps by chromatin structure. To test this model, we have measured the accessibility of restriction enzyme sites in a number of genes in isolated nuclei. Surprisingly, our data indicate that there is no difference in the overall accessibility of sites for several restriction enzymes on active versus inactive genes. However, consistent with our model, restriction enzyme recognition sequences that overlap with homeoprotein binding sites are less accessible on inactive genes than they are on active genes. We propose that transcriptional activation in all animals may involve a localized increase in accessibility at the AT-rich regions bound by homeoå_proteins and perhaps at a few other regions, rather than a generalized effect on all sites throughout a gene."
1126,2000,Accessing and distributing EMBL data using CORBA (common object request broker architecture),"Background:The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database is a comprehensive database of DNA and RNA sequences and related information traditionally made available in flat-file format. Queries through tools such as SRS (Sequence Retrieval System) also return data in flat-file format. Flat files have a number of shortcomings, however, and the resources therefore currently lack a flexible environment to meet individual researchers' needs. The Object Management Group's common object request broker architecture (CORBA) is an industry standard that provides platform-independent programming interfaces and models for portable distributed object-oriented computing applications. Its independence from programming languages, computing platforms and network protocols makes it attractive for developing new applications for querying and distributing biological data.Results:A CORBA infrastructure developed by EMBL-EBI provides an efficient means of accessing and distributing EMBL data. The EMBL object model is defined such that it provides a basis for specifying interfaces in interface definition language (IDL) and thus for developing the CORBA servers. The mapping from the object model to the relational schema in the underlying Oracle database uses the facilities provided by PersistenceTM, an object/relational tool. The techniques of developing loaders and 'live object caching' with persistent objects achieve a smart live object cache where objects are created on demand. The objects are managed by an evictor pattern mechanism.Conclusions:The CORBA interfaces to the EMBL database address some of the problems of traditional flat-file formats and provide an efficient means for accessing and distributing EMBL data. CORBA also provides a flexible environment for users to develop their applications by building clients to our CORBA servers, which can be integrated into existing systems."

The Internet has the capacity to transmit a volume of information that is both difficult to control and widely available. The OMCB emphasizes the necessity to contribute to the accreditation of medical/healthcare information diffused through the network, and the importance of offering support and assistance, whenever necessary, to physicians and medical institutions who wish to access this information and be present within the Internet.ObjectiveThe promotion from Official Medical College of Barcelona-Metges on line (OMCB) in Spain of an accredited medical web Seal (now called WMA of METGES on line) to give a reference guidelines of high quality based on Ethical Standards of the HON Code and the OMCB itself.MethodThrough a registration form the person in charge of the website asks for the accreditation web seal by accepting the rules proposed (Code of Conduct, Accreditation, Identification, Confidentiality, Control and validation, Advertising and other sources of financing, Non-compliance and responsibilities) . Then a peer-review of experts assesses the content, the site ownership, date of posting, revising, and updating and other characteristics defined in the guidelines. Later, the peer-reviewer sends a mail to explain the acceptance or not acceptance and the improvement necessary to receive the web seal in a second review. This is a free process. The accredited website will carry the medical seal on the homepage.ResultsAt the moment there are 76 webs accredited (Biomedical Associations, Patient Associations, Medical Institutions, Training, Scientific Societies, NGOs of Development, Conferences). Only 30% were initially accepted before the modifications needed to get the web seal were made. The main reason for not acceptance are: the dates that content is posted, revised, and updated are not clearly indicated and the source for specific content is not clearly identified (ie, author, organizational, institutional, or commercial provider/producer). There are 30 websites waiting for accreditation and everyday the OCMB is receiving new requests.Conclusions There is a big interest by all webs with medical contents to be accredited by a medical official institution as OMCB.The differences of contents and guidance of the websites make it difficult to use only one set of criteria to accredit these webs and makes it necessary to modify our Code to be able to assess their heterogeneousness.It would be necessary to have a system of different types of web seal to accredit the webs to guide professional and patient consumers and it would be very interesting to create an intelligent web data system to aid the peer-review the websites."
1129,2000,Accurate and rapid modeling of iron‰ÛÒbleomycin-induced DNA damage using tethered duplex oligonucleotides and electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometric analysis,"Bleomycin B2 (BLM) in the presence of iron [Fe(II)] and O2 catalyzes single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) cleavage of DNA. Electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry was used to monitor these cleavage processes. Two duplex oligonucleotides containing an ethylene oxide tether between both strands were used in this investigation, allowing facile monitoring of all ss and ds cleavage events. A sequence for site-specific binding and cleavage by Fe‰ÛÒBLM was incorporated into each analyte. One of these core sequences, GTAC, is a known hot-spot for ds cleavage, while the other sequence, GGCC, is a hot-spot for ss cleavage. Incubation of each oligonucleotide under anerobic conditions with Fe(II)‰ÛÒBLM allowed detection of the non-covalent ternary Fe‰ÛÒBLM/oligonucleotide complex in the gas phase. Cleavage studies were then performed utilizing O2-activated Fe(II)‰ÛÒBLM. No work-up or separation steps were required and direct MS and MS/MS analyses of the crude reaction mixtures confirmed sequence-specific Fe‰ÛÒBLM-induced cleavage. Comparison of the cleavage patterns for both oligonucleotides revealed sequence-dependent preferences for ss and ds cleavages in accordance with previously established gel electrophoresis analysis of hairpin oligonucleotides. This novel methodology allowed direct, rapid and accurate determination of cleavage profiles of model duplex oligonucleotides after exposure to activated Fe‰ÛÒBLM."
1130,2000,Accurate Prediction of Protein Functional Class From Sequence in the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and Escherichia Coli Genomes Using Data Mining,"The analysis of genomics data needs to become as automated as its generation. Here we present a novel data-mining approach to predicting protein functional class from sequence. This method is based on a combination of inductive logic programming clustering and rule learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the M. tuberculosis and E. coli genomes, and identify biologically interpretable rules which predict protein functional class from information only available from the sequence. These rules predict 65% of the ORFs with no assigned function in M. tuberculosis and 24% of those in E. coli, with an estimated accuracy of 60‰ÛÒ80% (depending on the level of functional assignment). The rules are founded on a combination of detection of remote homology, convergent evolution and horizontal gene transfer. We identify rules that predict protein functional class even in the absence of detectable sequence or structural homology. These rules give insight into the evolutionary history of M. tuberculosis and E. coli."
1131,2000,A centralized global automation group in a decentralized organization,"In the latter part of the 1990s, many companies have worked to foster a ‰Û÷matrix‰Ûª style culture through several changes in organizational structure.

At Glaxo Wellcome, this matrix culture is reflected in an automation strategy that relies on both centralized and decentralized resources. The Group Development Operations Information Systems Robotics Team is a centralized resource providing development, support, integration, and training in laboratory automation across businesses in the Development organization. The matrix culture still presents challenges with respect to communication and managing the development of technology. A current challenge for our team is to go beyond our recognized role as a technology resource and actually to influence automation strategies across the global Development organization.

1132,2000,Acetyltransferases and tumour suppression,"The acetyltransferase p300 was first identified associated with the adenoviral transforming protein E1A, suggesting a potential role for p300 in the regulation of cell proliferation. Direct evidence demonstrating a role for p300 in human tumours was lacking until the recentl publication by Gayther et al, which strongly supports a role for p300 as a tumour suppressor. The authors identify truncating mutations associated with the loss or mutation of the second allele in both tumour samples and cell lines, suggesting that loss of p300 may play a role in the development of a subset of human cancers."

1135,2000,"A cluster of pediatric metallic mercury exposure cases treated with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)","Nine children and their mother were exposed to vapors of metallic mercury. The source of the exposure appears to have been a 6-oz vial of mercury taken from a neighbor's home. The neighbor reportedly operated a business preparing mercury-filled amulets for practitioners of the Afro-Caribbean religion Santeria. At diagnosis, urinary mercury levels in the children ranged from 61 to 1,213 microg/g creatinine, with a geometric mean of 214.3 microg/m creatinine. All of the children were asymptomatic. To prevent development of neurotoxicity, we treated the children with oral meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). During chelation, the geometric mean urine level rose initially by 268% to 573.2 microg mercury/g creatinine (p&lt;0.0005). At the 6-week follow-up examination after treatment, the geometric mean urine mercury level had fallen to 102.1 microg/g creatinine, which was 17.8% of the geometric mean level observed during treatment (p&lt;0.0005) and 47.6% of the original baseline level (p&lt;0.001). Thus, oral chelation with DMSA produced a significant mercury diuresis in these children. We observed no adverse side effects of treatment. DMSA appears to be an effective and safe chelating agent for treatment of pediatric overexposure to metallic mercury.ImagesFigure 1"

1139,2000,"ACTH4 -10, Substance P, and Dizolcipine (Mk-801) Accelerate Functional Recovery After Hemilabyrinthectomy in Goldfish","In this study, we evaluated the goldfish model of hemilabyrinthectomy for investigating potential recovery-promoting drugs. In this lesion model, the unilateral removal of the labyrinth induces a postural imbalance in response to light (Dorsal Light Reflex), from which the animals can recover over time. The behavioral effects of two neuropeptides were tested‰ÛÒnamely, of substance P and ACTH4-10, both of which are known to promote functional recovery in several other lesion models. Furthermore, the effect of MK- 801, an antagonist of the glutamatergic NMDAreceptor subtype, was tested because this substance has also been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect. After lesion of the right labyrinth, the animals (n=12) were treated intraperitoneally daily either with vehicle (n=12), substance P (n=11), ACTH4-10 (n=12), or MK- 801 (n=12). Another group (n=11), which served as a non-lesion control, did not receive hemilabyrinthectomy or systemic injections. The lesion group, treated post-operatively with vehicle, did not recover from the postural deviation over the 24-d testing period. In contrast, all three test substances accelerated the functional recovery after unilateral labyrinthectomy. The decrease of the dorsal light reflex persisted even after cessation of drug treatment after 20d. The results indicate that using the dorsal light reflex in the model of hemilabyrinthectomy in goldfish provides a useful approach to studying the ability of potential new neurotrophic or neuroprotective drugs to promote functional recovery."
1140,2000,"Activation of c-myc promoter P1 by immunoglobulin ë¼åÊgene enhancers in Burkitt lymphoma: functional characterization of the intron enhancer motifs ë¼B, E box 1 and E box 2, and of the 3‰Û_ enhancer motif PU","Deregulated expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells carrying a t(2;8) translocation is mediated by a synergistic interaction of the translocated immunoglobulin (Ig) ë¼ gene intron (ë¼Ei) and 3‰Û_ (ë¼E3‰Û_) enhancers and characterized by a strong activation of the promoter P1. We have investigated the functional role of distinct ë¼ enhancer sequence motifs in P1 activation on both minichromosomes and reporter gene constructs. Stable and transient transfections of BL cells revealed critical roles of the ë¼Ei and ë¼E3‰Û_ elements ë¼B and PU, respectively. Joint mutation of ë¼B and PU completely abolished P1 activity, implying that an interaction of ë¼B- and PU-binding factors is essential for the enhancer synergism. Mutation of the E box 1 and E box 2 motifs markedly decreased P1 activity in transient but not in stable transfection experiments. Co-expression of the NF-ë¼B subunit p65(RelA) and Sp1, an essential factor for P1 transcription, in Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells synergistically enhanced promoter activity. Our results support a model which proposes cross-talk between promoter and enhancer binding factors as the basic mechanism for ë¼ enhancer-mediated c-myc activation in BL cells."
1141,2000,Activation of synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis: lack of expression of the tumour suppressor PTEN at sites of invasive growth and destruction,"In the present study, we searched for mutant PTEN transcripts in aggressive rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RA-SF) and studied the expression of PTEN in RA. By automated sequencing, no evidence for the presence of mutant PTEN transcripts was found. However, in situ hybridization on RA synovium revealed a distinct expression pattern of PTEN, with negligible staining in the lining layer but abundant expression in the sublining. Normal synovial tissue exhibited homogeneous staining for PTEN. In cultured RA-SF, only 40% expressed PTEN. Co-implantation of RA-SF and normal human cartilage into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice showed only limited expression of PTEN, with no staining in those cells aggressively invading the cartilage. Although PTEN is not genetically altered in RA, these findings suggest that a lack of PTEN expression may constitute a characteristic feature of activated RA-SF in the lining, and may thereby contribute to the invasive behaviour of RA-SF by maintaining their aggressive phenotype at sites of cartilage destruction."
1142,2000,Activation of the BRLF1 promoter and lytic cycle of Epstein‰ÛÒBarr virus by histone acetylation,"Histone acetylation alters the chromatin structure and activates the genes that are repressed by histone deacetylation. This investigation demonstrates that treating P3HR1 cells with trichostatin A (TSA) activates the Epstein‰ÛÒBarr virus (EBV) lytic cycle, allowing the virus to synthesize three viral lytic proteins‰ÛÓRta, Zta and EA-D. Experimental results indicate that TSA and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate synergistically activate the transcription of BRLF1, an immediate-early gene of EBV. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveals that histone H4 at the BRLF1 promoter is acetylated after P3HR1 cells are treated with TSA, suggesting that histone acetylation activates BRLF1 transcription. Furthermore, results in this study demonstrate that mutation of a YY1-binding site in the BRLF1 promoter activates BRLF1 transcription 1.6- and 2.3-fold in P3HR1 cells and C33A cells, respectively. Real time PCR analysis reveals that the mutation also increases the histone acetylation level of the nucleosomes at the BRLF1 promoter 1.64- and 3.08-fold in P3HR1 and C33A cells, respectively. Results presented herein suggest that histone deacetylation plays an important role in maintaining the viral latency and histone acetylation at the BRLF1 promoter allows the virus to express Rta and to activate the viral lytic cycle."
1143,2000,Activation of the Myc oncoprotein leads to increased turnover of thrombospondin-1 mRNA,"The Myc oncoprotein is implicated in transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes pertaining to cell cycle and neoplastic transformation. Examples of both positive and negative regulation have been reported that involve E-box and initiator (Inr) promoter elements, respectively. In both cases, Myc is thought to induce changes in transcription initiation. We have previously shown that overexpression of Myc causes down-regulation of the thrombospondin-1 (tsp-1) gene, an important negative modulator of tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that Myc in combination with Max can bind, albeit with low affinity, to an E-box-like element in the tsp-1 promoter. However, the 2.7 kb DNA segment containing both this non-canonical E-box and an Inr-like sequence does not constitute a Myc-responsive element in a transient expression system. Furthermore, Myc does not significantly affect the rate of initiation or elongation of the tsp-1 mRNA. Thus, in this instance Myc does not act as a canonical transcription factor. Instead, as demonstrated by blocking de novo RNA synthesis, down-regulation of the tsp-1 gene by Myc occurs through increased mRNA turnover. To our knowledge, this is the first example of gene regulation by Myc that involves mRNA destabilization."
1144,2000,Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 in airway smooth muscle: a potential pathway that modulates bronchial hyper-responsiveness in asthma?,"The cellular and molecular mechanisms that are involved in airway hyper-responsiveness are unclear. Current studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-ë±, a cytokine that is produced in considerable quantities in asthmatic airways, may potentially be involved in the development of bronchial hyper-responsiveness by directly altering the contractile properties of the airway smooth muscle (ASM). The underlying mechanisms are not known, but growing evidence now suggests that most of the biologic effects of TNF-ë± on ASM are mediated by the p55 receptor or tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1. In addition, activation of TNFR1 coupled to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2-nuclear factor-ë¼B (NF-ë¼B) pathway alters calcium homeostasis in ASM, which appears to be a new potential mechanism underlying ASM hyper-responsiveness."
1145,2000,Active site constraints in the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by bacterial RNase P: analysis of precursor tRNAs with a single 3‰Û_-S-phosphorothiolate internucleotide linkage,"Endonucleolytic processing of precursor tRNAs (ptRNAs) by RNase P yields 3‰Û_-OH and 5‰Û_-phosphate termini, and at least two metal ions are thought to be essential for catalysis. To determine if the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by bacterial RNase P (RNAs) involves stabilization of the 3‰Û_-oxyanion leaving group by direct coordination to one of the catalytic metal ions, ptRNA substrates with single 3‰Û_-S-phosphorothiolate linkages at the RNase P cleavage site were synthesized. With a 3‰Û_-S-phosphorothiolate-modified ptRNA carrying a 7 nt 5‰Û_-flank, a complete shift of the cleavage site to the next unmodified phosphodiester in the 5‰Û_-direction was observed. Cleavage at the modified linkage was not restored in the presence of thiophilic metal ions, such as Mn2+ or Cd2+. To suppress aberrant cleavage, we also constructed a 3‰Û_-S-phosphorothiolate-modified ptRNA with a 1 nt 5‰Û_-flank. No detectable cleavage of this substrate was seen in reactions catalyzed by RNase P RNAs from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, independent of the presence of thiophilic metal ions. Ground state binding of modified ptRNAs was not impaired, suggesting that the 3‰Û_-S-phosphorothiolate modification specifically prevents formation of the transition state, possibly by excluding catalytic metal ions from the active site."
1146,2000,Active synovial matrix metalloproteinase-2 is associated with radiographic erosions in patients with early synovitis,"Serum and synovial tissue expression of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 and their molecular regulators, MMP-14 and TIMP-2 was examined in 28 patients with inflammatory early synovitis and 4 healthy volunteers and correlated with the presence of erosions in the patients. Immunohistological staining of MMP-2, MMP-14 and TIMP-2 localized to corresponding areas in the synovial lining layer and was almost absent in normal synovium. Patients with radiographic erosions had significantly higher levels of active MMP-2 than patients with no erosions, suggesting that activated MMP-2 levels in synovial tissue may be a marker for a more aggressive synovial lesion."
1147,2000,Activities of the National Institutes of Health relating to energy efficiency and pollution prevention.,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of the world's premier biomedical research centers. Although NIH owns and operates more than 1,300 acres and 197 buildings across the country, the main campus is in Bethesda, Maryland. This campus consists of over 312 acres and 75 laboratories and other buildings, which consume vast amounts of energy. Aware of the NIH role in setting biomedical research agendas and priorities, its administrators strive to set good examples in energy efficiency and pollution prevention. Three current projects are presented as ""best practices"" examples of meeting the stated commitment of NIH to leadership in environmental stewardship: a) design and current construction of a 250-bed clinical research hospital designed to allow conversion of patient care units to research laboratories and vice-versa; b) design and construction of a six-story research laboratory that combines energy-saving innovations with breakthroughs in research technologies; and c) a massive, $200-million modernization of the campus utility infrastructure that involves generation systems for steam and chilled water and distribution systems for chilled water, steam, potable water, electricity, communications and computer networking, compressed air, and natural gas. Based on introduction of energy-efficiency measures, millions of dollars in savings for energy needs are projected; already the local electric utility has granted several million dollars in rebates. The guiding principles of NIH environmental stewardship help to ensure that energy conservation measures maximize benefits versus cost and also balance expediency with efficiency within available funding resources.

1150,2000,Acute effects of polychlorinated biphenyl-containing and -free transformer fluids on rat testicular steroidogenesis.,"Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-based transformer fluids belong to a class of environmentally persistent mixtures with known toxic effects. Here, we studied the acute effects of Askarel (which contains Aroclor 1260) and two substitute transformer fluids (the silicone oil-based DC561 and the mineral oil-based ENOL C) on rat testicular steroidogenesis. Single intraperitoneal (ip; 10 mg/kg body weight) or bilateral intratesticular (itt; 25 microg/testis) injections of Askarel markedly decreased serum androgen levels 24 hr after administration. In acute testicular cultures from these animals, chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone and androgen productions were severely attenuated. When itt was injected or added in vitro, Askarel inhibited 3ss-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3ssHSD), stimulated 17[alpha]-hydroxylase/lyase (P450c17), and did not affect 17ss-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in testicular postmitochondrial fractions. The ip-injected Askarel did not affect 3ssHSD, but inhibited P450c17, suggesting that a more intensive metabolism of peripherally injected Askarel reduces the circulating levels of active ingredients below the threshold needed for inhibition of 3ssHSD and generates a derivative that inhibits P450c17. In contrast to Askarel, itt-injection (25 microg/testis) of DC561 and ENOL C did not affect in vivo and in vitro steroidogenesis. These findings show the acute effects of Askarel, but not silicone and mineral oils, on testicular steroidogenesis."
1151,2001,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases the expression of the CaT1 epithelial calcium channel in the Caco-2 human intestinal cell line","BackgroundThe active hormonal form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) is the primary regulator of intestinal calcium absorption efficiency. In vitamin D deficiency, intestinal calcium absorption is low leading to an increased risk of developing negative calcium balance and bone loss. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has been shown to stimulate calcium absorption in experimental animals and in human subjects. However, the molecular details of calcium transport across the enterocyte are not fully defined. Recently, two novel epithelial calcium channels (CaT1/ECaC2 and ECaC1/CaT2) have been cloned and suggested to be important in regulating intestinal calcium absorption. However, to date neither gene has been shown to be regulated by vitamin D status. We have previously shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin stimulates transcellular calcium transport in Caco-2 cells, a human intestinal cell line.ResultsIn the current study, we have demonstrated that Caco-2 cells express low but detectable levels of CaT1 mRNA in the absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment. CaT1 mRNA expression is rapidly up regulated (4-fold increase at 4 h and 10-fold at 24 h) by treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (10-7 moles/L). Moreover, the increase in CaT1 mRNA expression preceded by several hours the vitamin D induction of calbindin D9K, a putative cytosolic calcium transport protein.ConclusionThese observations are the first to demonstrate regulation of CaT1 expression by vitamin D and are consistent with a new model of intestinal calcium absorption wherein vitamin D-mediated changes in brush border membrane CaT1 levels could be the primary gatekeeper regulating homeostatic modulation of intestinal calcium absorption efficiency."
1152,2001,14-3-3ìã associates with and activates the MEF2D transcription factor during muscle cell differentiation,"Myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2) proteins belong to the MADS box family of transcription factors and four MEF2 proteins, MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C and MEF2D, have been found. MEF2 proteins have been shown to play critical roles in differentiation of muscles and neuronal tissues. How transactivational activity of MEF2 proteins is regulated is not fully understood. MEF2 proteins are activated by several kinases, including Erk5 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, and interact with repressors, including histone deacetylases 4 and 5 (HDAC4 and HDAC5) and Cabin1. During the effort to understand regulation of MEF2 activity, we identified 14-3-3ìã as a MEF2D-interacting molecule by yeast two-hybrid screening. We found that 14-3-3ìã forms a complex with MEF2D in vivo and specifically enhances MEF2 transactivational activity. The results from transient transfection and co-precipitation experiments suggest that 14-3-3ìã activates MEF2D by competitively inhibiting HDAC4 from binding to MEF2D and thereby affects muscle cell differentiation."
1153,2001,"15-Ketodihydro-PGF2ë±, Progesterone and Cortisol Profiles in Heifers after Induction of Parturition by Injection of Dexamethasone","In order to study rapid changes in 15-ketodihydro-PGF2ë±, cortisol and progesterone in the period preceding parturition in cattle, pre-term parturition was induced in 4 late pregnant heifers. Parturitions were induced by 2 intramuscular injections of 20 mg dexamethasone with a 24-h interval. The first injection was made on days 254, 258, 264 and 265 in gestation, respectively. Twenty-four h before the first injection an intravenous polyurethane cannula was inserted. Blood samples were collected at least every hour until 12 h after parturition and during the second stage of labour at least 6 times per hour. Plasma was analysed for 15-ketodihydro-PGF2ë± and progesterone by radioimmunoassays, and for cortisol by an ELISA. The average time from injection to parturition was 7.7 (6.6‰ÛÒ8.9) days (mean (range)). Two of the heifers had retained foetal membranes (RFM). At the start of the experiment the levels of PGF2ë± metabolite were low (&lt; 300 pmol/L) and increased slowly to levels between 1000 and 2000 pmol/L at one day before parturition. During the last day, however, the levels increased rapidly and the highest levels (&gt;10000 pmol/L) were reached at the time of delivery. No pulsatile release was seen. Immediately after foetal expulsion the PG-metabolite levels decreased rapidly in all animals. In the 2 animals with RFM, however, this decline ceased within a few h. The PG-metabolite levels in these animals then started to increase and reached levels as high as during parturition. Luteolysis occurred between 1.6 and 0.4 days before parturition in all animals. The cortisol profile showed a distinct peak at the time of parturition in the RFM heifers. This peak was absent in the non-RFM heifers. This study shows that the PGF2ë± release at prepartal luteolysis and parturition is not pulsatile in cattle and that cortisol profiles in heifers with retained foetal membranes might differ from the profiles in non-RFM heifers at the time of parturition."
1154,2001,17beta-estradiol promotes the synthesis and the secretion of annexin I in the CCRF-CEM human cell line.,"AIMS: Annexin I (ANXA1), a 37kDa member of the annexin family of Ca2+-binding and phospholipid-binding proteins, is particularly abundant in various populations of peripheral blood leukocytes. Since this protein modulates the anti-inflammatory actions of the steroid hormones, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the female sex steroid hormone, 17beta-estradiol (E2beta), on the synthesis and secretion of ANXA1 in the human CCRF-CEM acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. METHODS: Complementary reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays were performed to study the effect of E2beta on the expression of mRNA and protein ANXA1, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Treatment of CCRF-CEM cells with E2beta, for 30 min, stimulated the synthesis of ANXA1 mRNA molecules, and increased the cellular level of ANXA1 protein. Moreover, when the cells were incubated with E2beta under the same experimental conditions, a significant increase in the amount of ANXA1 secreted from the cells was also detected. ICI 182,780, a selective inhibitor of the intracellular estrogen receptor, had no effect on the E2beta-stimulated expression and externalisation of ANXA1. Taken together, these results indicate that E2beta induces de novo synthesis of ANXA1 and stimulates its secretion in the CCRF-CEM cell line, apparently through a mechanism independent of the intracellular estrogen receptor."
1155,2001,"1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct formation in aortic DNA following inhalation of acrolein.","Recent reports indicate that many of the cytotoxic and health-threatening components of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) reside in the vapor phase of the smoke. We have reported previously that inhalation of 1,3-butadiene, a prominent vapor phase component of ETS, accelerates arteriosclerotic plaque development in cockerels. In this study we asked whether inhaled acrolein, a reactive aldehyde that is also a prominent vapor-phase component of ETS, damages artery-wall DNA and accelerates plaque development. Cockerels inhaled 0, 1, or 10 ppm acrolein mixed with HEPA-filtered air for 6 hr. Half were killed immediately (day 1 group) for detection of the stable, premutagenic 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine acrolein adduct (AdG3) in aortic DNA via a (32)P-postlabeling/HPLC method, and half were killed after 10 days (day 10 group) for indirect assessment of adduct repair. In the day 1 group, acrolein-DNA adducts were 5 times higher in the 1 and 10 ppm groups than in HEPA-filtered air controls. However, in the day 10 group, adduct levels in the 1 and 10 ppm acrolein groups were reduced to the control adduct level. For the plaque studies, cockerels inhaled 1 ppm acrolein (6 hr/day, 8 weeks), mixed with the same HEPA-filtered air inhaled by controls. Plaque development was measured blind by computerized morphometry. Unlike butadiene inhalation, acrolein inhalation did not accelerate plaque development. Thus, even though repeated exposure to acrolein alone has no effect on plaque size under the exposure conditions described here, a single, brief inhalation exposure to acrolein elicits repairable DNA damage to the artery wall. These results suggest that frequent exposure to ETS may lead to persistent artery-wall DNA damage and thus provide sites on which other ETS plaque accelerants can act."

Arthritis researchers from around the globe should be strongly encouraged to attend future meetings, the next of which is the 22nd EWRR meeting in Leiden, the Netherlands, in 2002."
1158,2001,5‰Û_- and 3‰Û_-terminal nucleotides in the FGFR2 ISAR splicing element core have overlapping roles in exon IIIb activation and exon IIIc repression,"The cell type-specific, mutually-exclusive alternative splicing of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) pre-mRNA is tightly regulated. A sequence termed ISAR (intronic splicing activator and repressor) has been implicated as an important cisåÊregulatory element in both activation of exon IIIb and repression of exon IIIc splicing in epithelial cells. In order to better understand how this single sequence could have dual roles, we transfected minigenes containing a series of 2-bp mutations in the 18 3‰Û_-most nucleotides of ISAR that we refer to as the ISAR core. Transfection of cells with dual-exon (IIIb and IIIc) minigenes revealed that mutation of terminal sequences of the core led to decreased exon IIIb inclusion and increased exon IIIc inclusion. Transfection of cells with single-exon IIIb minigenes and single-exon IIIc minigenes revealed that mutation ofåÊterminal sequences of the ISAR core led to decreased exon IIIb inclusion and increased exon IIIc inclusion, respectively. Nucleotides of the ISAR core responsible for exon IIIb activation appear to overlap very closely with those required for exon IIIc repression. We describe a model in which ISAR and a 5‰Û_åÊintronic sequence known as IAS2 form a stem structure required for simultaneous exon IIIb activation and exon IIIc repression."
1159,2001,5‰Û_-bis-pyrenylated oligonucleotides displaying excimer fluorescence provide sensitive probes of RNA sequence and structure,"Oligonucleotide conjugates bearing two pyrene residues attached to 5‰Û_-phosphate through a phosphoramide bond were synthesised. Fluorescence spectra of the conjugates show a peak typical of monomer emission (ëÈmax 382 nm) and a broad emission peak with ëÈmax 476 nm, which indicates the excimer formation between the two pyrene residues. Conjugation of these two pyrene residues to the 5‰Û_-phosphate of oligonucleotides does not affect the stabilities of heteroduplexes formed by conjugates with the corresponding linear strands. A monomer fluorescence of the conjugates is considerably affected by the heteroduplex formation allowing the conjugates to be used as fluorescent hybridisation probes. The 5‰Û_-bis-pyrenylated oligonucleotides have been successfully used for investigation of affinity and kinetics of antisense oligonucleotides binding to the multidrug resistance gene 1 (PGY1/MDR1) mRNA. The changes of excimer fluorescence of the conjugates occurring during hybridisation depended on the structure of the binding sites: hybridisation to heavily structured parts of RNA resulted in quenching of the excimer fluorescence, while binding to RNA regions with a loose secondary structure was accompanied by an enhancement of the excimer fluorescence. Potentially, these conjugates may be considered as fluorescent probes for RNA structure investigation."
1160,2001,5-Fluorouracil-induced cardiotoxicity mimicking myocardial infarction: a case report,"BackgroundSevere cardiotoxicity is a documented, but very unusual side-effect of intravenous 5-fluorouracil therapy. The mechanism producing cardiotoxicity is poorly understood.Case presentationA case of 5-fluorouracil-induced cardiotoxicity, possibly due to coronary artery spasm, and mimicking acute anterolateral myocardial infarction is presented and discussed. Electrocardiographs highlighting the severity of the presentation are included in the report along with coronary angiograms demonstrating the absence of significant coronary atherosclerosis.ConclusionSevere 5-fluorouracil-induced cardiotoxicity is rare, but can be severe and may mimic acute myocardial infarction, leading to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Readministration of 5-fluorouracil is not advised following an episode of cardiotoxicity."
1161,2001,5-Methylcytosine DNA glycosylase participates in the genome-wide loss of DNA methylation occurring during mouse myoblast differentiation,"Changes in gene expression during mouse myoblast differentiation were monitored by DNA microarray hybridisation. Four days after the onset of differentiation 2.37% of the genes increased in activity from a value of zero, whereas during the same time 1.68% of total genes had decreased expression. During the first 24 h of differentiation an average of 700 000 CpG sites per haploid genome were demethylated. Maximal loss of DNA methylation is attained after 2 days of differentiation, followed by a gradual remethylation. The highest demethylation is observed in highly repeated DNA sequences, followed by single copy sequences. When DNA replication is inhibited by aphidicolin or l-mimosine this genome-wide demethylation is still observed. During the first 3 h of differentiation there is an increase in the number of hemimethylated CpG sites, which disappear rapidly during the course of genome-wide hypomethylation. Transfection of cells with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase (G/T mismatch DNA glycosylase) decreases both the activity of the enzyme and genome-wide demethylation. It is concluded that the genome-wide loss of DNA methylation in differentiating mouse myoblasts occurs in part by formation of hemimethylated CpG sites, which can serve as the substrate for 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase."
1162,2001,"A basis for a visual language for describing, archiving and analyzing functional models of complex biological systems","Background:We propose that a computerized, internet-based graphical description language for systems biology will be essential for describing, archiving and analyzing complex problems of biological function in health and disease.Results:We outline here a conceptual basis for designing such a language and describe BioD, a prototype language that we have used to explore the utility and feasibility of this approach to functional biology. Using example models, we demonstrate that a rather limited lexicon of icons and arrows suffices to describe complex cell-biological systems as discrete models that can be posted and linked on the internet.Conclusions:Given available computer and internet technology, BioD may be implemented as an extensible, multidisciplinary language that can be used to archive functional systems knowledge and be extended to support both qualitative and quantitative functional analysis."
1163,2001,Abduction paresis with rostral pontine and/or mesencephalic lesions: Pseudoabducens palsy and its relation to the so-called posterior internuclear ophthalmoplegia of Lutz,"BackgroundThe existence of a prenuclear abduction paresis is still debated.MethodsIn a retrospective design, we identified 22 patients with isolated unilateral (n = 20) or bilateral (n = 2) abduction paresis and electrophysiologic abnormalities indicating rostral pontine and/or mesencephalic lesions. Another 11 patients had unilateral abduction paresis with additional ocular motor abnormalities indicating midbrain dysfunction. Eight of these 11 patients also had electrophysiological abnormalities supporting this location. Electrophysiological examinations in all patients included masseter and blink reflexes (MassR, BlinkR), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), and direct current elctro-oculography (EOG).ResultsUnilateral MassR abnormalities in patients with unilateral abduction paresis were seen in 17 patients and were almost always (in 16 of 17 patients) on the side of the abduction paresis. Another 11 patients had bilateral MassR abnormalities. BlinkR was always normal. EOG disclosed slowed abduction saccades in the non-paretic eye in 6 patients and slowed saccades to the side opposite to the abduction paresis in another 5 patients. Re-examinations were done in 27 patients showing normalization or improvement of masseter reflex abnormalities in 18 of 20 patients and in all patients with EOG abnormalities. This was always associated with clinical improvement.ConclusionsElectrophysiologically documented or clinically evident rostral pontine and/or mesencephalic lesions in our patients exclude an infranuclear intrapontine 6th nerve lesion and indicate the existence of an abduction paresis of prenuclear origin. An increased tone of the antagonistic medial rectus muscle during lateral gaze either by abnormal convergence or impaired medial rectus inhibition seems most likely."
1164,2001,A biologically based model of growth and senescence of Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells after exposure to arsenic.,"We modified the two-stage Moolgavkar-Venzon-Knudson (MVK) model for use with Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cell neoplastic progression. Five phenotypic stages are proposed in this model: Normal cells can either become senescent or mutate into immortal cells followed by anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenic stages. The growth of normal SHE cells was controlled by their division, death, and senescence rates, and all senescent cells were converted from normal cells. In this report, we tested the modeling of cell kinetics of the first two phenotypic stages against experimental data evaluating the effects of arsenic on SHE cells. We assessed cell division and death rates using flow cytometry and correlated cell division rates to the degree of confluence of cell cultures. The mean cell death rate was approximately equal to 1% of the average division rate. Arsenic did not induce immortalization or further mutations of SHE cells at concentrations of 2 microM and below, and chromium (3.6 microM) and lead (100 microM) had similar negative results. However, the growth of SHE cells was inhibited by 5.4 microM arsenic after a 2-day exposure, with cells becoming senescent after only 16 population doublings. In contrast, normal cells and cells exposed to lower arsenic concentrations grew normally for at least 30 population doublings. The biologically based model successfully predicted the growth of normal and arsenic-treated cells, as well as the senescence rates. Mechanisms responsible for inducing cellular senescence in SHE cells exposed to arsenic may help explain the apparent inability of arsenic to induce neoplasia in experimental animals."
1165,2001,Ablation of atrial fibrillation: a procedure come of age?,"Various approaches for catheter ablation of focal initiators of atrial fibrillation or the substrate for maintaining atrial fibrillation have evolved over the past 5 years. Despite these advances, there are still a large number of unresolved issues regarding the efficacy and safety of these procedures as well as optimal patient selection for the different approaches. These uncertainties raise questions about the applicability at the present time of atrial fibrillation as front-line therapy within the community."
1166,2001,Abnormal expression of p27kip1 protein in levator ani muscle of aging women with pelvic floor disorders ‰ÛÒ a relationship to the cellular differentiation and degeneration,"BackgroundPelvic floor disorders affect almost 50% of aging women. An important role in the pelvic floor support belongs to the levator ani muscle. The p27/kip1 (p27) protein, multifunctional cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, shows changing expression in differentiating skeletal muscle cells during development, and relatively high levels of p27 RNA were detected in the normal human skeletal muscles.MethodsBiopsy samples of levator ani muscle were obtained from 22 symptomatic patients with stress urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and overlaps (age range 38‰ÛÒ74), and nine asymptomatic women (age 31‰ÛÒ49). Cryostat sections were investigated for p27 protein expression and type I (slow twitch) and type II (fast twitch) fibers.ResultsAll fibers exhibited strong plasma membrane (and nuclear) p27 protein expression. cytoplasmic p27 expression was virtually absent in asymptomatic women. In perimenopausal symptomatic patients (ages 38‰ÛÒ55), muscle fibers showed hypertrophy and moderate cytoplasmic p27 staining accompanied by diminution of type II fibers. Older symptomatic patients (ages 57‰ÛÒ74) showed cytoplasmic p27 overexpression accompanied by shrinking, cytoplasmic vacuolization and fragmentation of muscle cells. The plasma membrane and cytoplasmic p27 expression was not unique to the muscle cells. Under certain circumstances, it was also detected in other cell types (epithelium of ectocervix and luteal cells).ConclusionsThis is the first report on the unusual (plasma membrane and cytoplasmic) expression of p27 protein in normal and abnormal human striated muscle cells in vivo. Our data indicate that pelvic floor disorders are in perimenopausal patients associated with an appearance of moderate cytoplasmic p27 expression, accompanying hypertrophy and transition of type II into type I fibers. The patients in advanced postmenopause show shrinking and fragmentation of muscle fibers associated with strong cytoplasmic p27 expression."
1167,2001,Abnormalities of sexual development in male rats with in utero and lactational exposure to the antiandrogenic plasticizer Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.,"Several members of the phthalate ester family have antiandrogenic properties, yet little is known about how exposure to these ubiquitous environmental contaminants early in development may affect sexual development. We conducted experiments to determine effects of in utero and lactational exposure to the most prevalent phthalate ester, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on male reproductive system development and sexual behavior. Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with corn oil or DEHP (0, 375, 750, or 1,500 mg/kg/day, per os) from gestation day 3 through postnatal day (PND) 21. Dose-related effects on male offspring included reduced anogenital distance, areola and nipple retention, undescended testes, and permanently incomplete preputial separation. Testis, epididymis, glans penis, ventral prostate, dorsolateral prostate, anterior prostate, and seminal vesicle weights were reduced at PND 21, 63, and/or 105-112. Additional dose-related effects included a high incidence of anterior prostate agenesis, a lower incidence of partial or complete ventral prostate agenesis, occasional dorsolateral prostate and seminal vesicle agenesis, reduced sperm counts, and testicular, epididymal, and penile malformations. Many DEHP-exposed males were sexually inactive in the presence of receptive control females, but sexual inactivity did not correlate with abnormal male reproductive organs. These results suggest that in utero and lactational DEHP exposure also inhibited sexually dimorphic central nervous system development. No major abnormalities were found in any of eight control litters, but DEHP caused severe male reproductive system toxicity in five of eight litters at 375 mg/kg/day, seven of eight litters at 750 mg/kg/day, and five of five litters at 1,500 mg/kg/day. These results demonstrate that the male reproductive system is far more sensitive to DEHP early in development than when animals are exposed as juveniles or adults. The effects of DEHP on male reproductive organs and sexual behaviors and the lack of significant effects on time to vaginal opening and first estrus in their littermates demonstrate that DEHP (and/or its metabolites) affects development of the male reproductive system primarily by acting as an antiandrogen. The pattern of effects of in utero and lactational DEHP exposure differed from patterns caused by other phthalate esters, and the preponderance of anterior prostate agenesis appears to be unique among all chemicals. These results suggest that DEHP acts partly by mechanisms distinct from those of other antiandrogens."
1168,2001,"Abnormal uterine bleeding: an evaluation endometrial biopsy, vaginal ultrasound and outpatient hysteroscopy.","Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common gynaecological symptom. Whilst most patients have benign disease, thorough investigation is necessary, particularly in the peri- and post-menopausal woman. Hysteroscopy with directed biopsy of suspicious lesions is the gold standard investigation but it is invasive and is not offered in all units as an outpatient procedure. Ultrasound and outpatient biopsy techniques may allow patients to be triaged to select those who require formal evaluation by hysteroscopy. We assessed the records of 100 consecutive referrals to the outpatient hysteroscopy clinic at the Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast. In order to develop a nomogram for the investigation of women with abnormal bleeding patterns, we compared ultrasound/biopsy diagnoses with hysteroscopy/biopsy diagnosis. Pre- and peri-menopausal patients, and post-menopausal patients taking hormone replacement therapy should be investigated further if the endometrial thickness is more than 10 mm, if endometrial biopsy is abnormal, or if symptoms are recurrent. Similarly, post-menopausal patients not taking hormone replacement therapy with an endometrial thickness of 5 mm or more should be referred for hysteroscopy."
1169,2001,Absence of rapid selection for acyclovir or penciclovir resistance following suboptimal oral prodrug therapy of HSV-infected mice,"BackgroundAcyclovir (ACV) resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolates can be readily selected in animal infection models receiving suboptimal ACV treatment, however no comparative studies of the emergence of resistance following suboptimal treatment with valacyclovir (VCV) or famciclovir (FCV), the prodrugs of acyclovir and penciclovir, respectively, have been reported.MethodsMice (n = 30) were infected with HSV type 1 or 2 in the ear pinnae and administered oral prodrugs at one fifth a dose previously shown to be effective. To select and amplify drug-resistant HSV, a total of seven consecutive in vivo passages with suboptimal treatment were performed for each virus sample and progeny virus from each passage was characterized by the plaque reduction (PRA) and plating efficiency assays (PEA).ResultsNo drug-resistant HSV-2 and only a single drug-resistant HSV-1 variant were identified. Virus recovered from the first three sequential passages of this HSV-1 sample was susceptible by PRA, although the proportion of resistant virus recovered gradually increased upon passage. The resistant HSV-1 phenotype was confirmed by PRA after four sequential passages in mice. Unexpectedly, this in vivo-selected drug-resistant HSV-1 failed to yield an infection completely refractory to treatment in subsequent passages.ConclusionsSub-optimal therapy of immunocompetent mice with either VCV or FCV did not readily select for HSV-mutants resistant to either ACV or PCV, suggesting that selection of resistance with either prodrug remains difficult using this system. Futhermore, this study suggests that the PEA may represent a useful adjunct to the PRA for monitoring alterations in the proportion of drug-resistant virus even when no change in IC50 is apparent."
1170,2001,Absence of the palmaris longus muscle: a population study.,"We examined 300 Caucasian subjects (150 males, 150 females) aged 18-40 years to assess the incidence of palmaris longus absence. The presence or absence of palmaris longus was assessed by clinical inspection. Forty-nine subjects had unilateral absence of palmaris longus (16%). The tendon was absent bilaterally in 26 subjects (9%). Unilateral and bilateral absence was more common in males, however this was not statistically significant (p = 0.25 and 0.56 respectively). In those subjects with unilateral absence, the right side was found to be more commonly affected however no statistical significance was evident (p = 0.25).ImagesFig 1Fig 2"

It will be of interest to determine the proportions of genes containing such domains in the proteomes of different eukaryotes.ResultsThe average proportion of conserved domains in each of five eukaryote genomes was calculated. In pairwise genome comparisons, the ratio of genes containing a given conserved domain in the two genomes on average reflected the ratio of the predicted total gene numbers of the two genomes. These ratios have been verified using a repository of databases and one of its subdivisions of conserved domains.ConclusionsMany conserved domains occur as a constant proportion of proteome size across the five sequenced eukaryotic genomes. This raises the possibility that this proportion is maintained because of functional constraints on interacting domains. The universality of the ratio in the five eukaryotic genomes attests to its potential importance."
1180,2001,A case-control study of autism and mumps-measles-rubella vaccination using the general practice research database: design and methodology,BackgroundAn association between mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccination and the onset of symptoms typical of autism has recently been suggested. This has led to considerable concern about the safety of the vaccine.MethodsA matched case-control study using data derived form the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database. Children with a possible diagnosis of autism will be identified from their electronic health records. All diagnoses will be validated by a detailed review of hospital letters and by using information derived from a parental questionnaire. Ten controls per case will be selected from the database. Conditional logistic regression will be used to assess the association between MMR vaccination and autism. In addition case series analyses will be undertaken to estimate the relative incidence of onset of autism in defined time intervals after vaccination. The study is funded by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council.DiscussionElectronic health databases offer tremendous opportunities for evaluating the adverse effects of vaccines. However there is much scope for bias and confounding. The rigorous validation of all diagnoses and the collection of additional information by parental questionnaire in this study are essential to minimise the possibility of misleading results.
1181,2001,A Case of Tracheobronchopathia Osteochondroplastica Diagnosed by Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy Upon Removal of an Aspirated Crown,"Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is a relatively rare benign disease, around 300 and 130 cases have been reported in English and Japanese literature, respectively. Most of the cases have been diagnosed incidentally at autopsy. Due to the widespread use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB), the number of cases diagnosed upon examination is increasing. Here, we report a case of a 72 year-old man with a history of crown aspiration, who was diagnosed as TO upon removal of a foreign body using FOB. The diagnosis of TO and the removal of an aspirated crown by FOB are discussed."
1182,2001,Acceptability of local made baits for oral vaccination of dogs against rabies in the Philippines,"BackgroundIn the Philippines, traditional mass dog vaccination campaigns have only achieved limited and transient success in dog rabies control, mainly because a large segment of the dog population is not accessible for traditional parenteral vaccination. Oral vaccination of dogs has been suggested as a supplementary method to increase the overall vaccination coverage of the dog populations involved. For this purpose, it is necessary to identify a suitable bait that is readily accepted by local dogs and that can be prepared without high costs.Materials and MethodsDuring a field study, dog bait-acceptance of several baits, made from inexpensive local available material, was examined in the Philippines.ResultsOf three baits tested, chickenneck, intestine, and boiled-intestine, the latter, made from boiled sections of the larger intestine of domestic pigs, had the highest acceptance-rate: none of the dogs that were offered a bait refused it, except for two dogs that ran away when approached.Other derivatives of the boiled-intestine bait were also accepted by almost all dogs. These baits, using the serosa of the smaller intestine as bait matrix were filled with fish, beef or pork scraps. However, preparation-time was longer and the costs of bait material were higher than those for the boiled-intestine bait (0.01 U$).ConclusionThe boiled-intestine bait can be produced at very low costs using locally available material and is extremely well accepted by local dogs, hence, providing a realistic opportunity to incorporate oral vaccination of dogs in the national rabies programme of the Philippines."
1183,2001,Access Control based on Attribute Certificates for Medical Intranet Applications,"BackgroundClinical information systems frequently use intranet and Internet technologies. However these technologies have emphasized sharing and not security, despite the sensitive and private nature of much health information. Digital certificates (electronic documents which recognize an entity or its attributes) can be used to control access in clinical intranet applications.ObjectivesTo outline the need for access control in distributed clinical database systems, to describe the use of digital certificates and security policies, and to propose the architecture for a system using digital certificates, cryptography and security policy to control access to clinical intranet applications.MethodsWe have previously developed a security policy, DIMEDAC (Distributed Medical Database Access Control), which is compatible with emerging public key and privilege management infrastructure. In our implementation approach we propose the use of digital certificates, to be used in conjunction with DIMEDAC.ResultsOur proposed access control system consists of two phases: the ways users gain their security credentials; and how these credentials are used to access medical data. Three types of digital certificates are used: identity certificates for authentication; attribute certificates for authorization; and access-rule certificates for propagation of access control policy. Once a user is identified and authenticated, subsequent access decisions are based on a combination of identity and attribute certificates, with access-rule certificates providing the policy framework.ConclusionsAccess control in clinical intranet applications can be successfully and securely managed through the use of digital certificates and the DIMEDAC security policy."
1184,2001,Accessibility of DNA polymerases to repair synthesis during nucleotide excision repair in yeast cell-free extracts,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes a variety of DNA lesions. Using a yeast cell-free repair system, we have analyzed the repair synthesis step of NER. NER was proficient in yeast mutant cell-free extracts lacking DNA polymerases (Pol) ë_, ë¦ or ëá. Base excision repair was also proficient without Polë_. Repair synthesis of NER was not affected by thermal inactivation of the temperature-sensitive mutant Polë± (pol1-17), but was reduced after thermal inactivation of the temperature-sensitive mutant Polë« (pol3-1) or PolƒÝ (pol2-18). Residual repair synthesis was observed in pol3-1 and pol2-18 mutant extracts, suggesting a repair deficiency rather than a complete repair defect. Deficient NER in pol3-1 and pol2-18 mutant extracts was specifically complemented by purified yeast Polë« and PolƒÝ, respectively. Deleting the polymerase catalytic domain of PolƒÝ (pol2-16) also led to a deficient repair synthesis during NER, which was complemented by purified yeast PolƒÝ, but not by purified yeast Polëá. These results suggest that efficient repair synthesis of yeast NER requires both Polë« and PolƒÝ in vitro, and that the low fidelity Polëá is not accessible to repair synthesis during NER."
1185,2001,Accumulation of H/ACA snoRNPs depends on the integrity of the conserved central domain of the RNA-binding protein Nhp2p,"Box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (H/ACA snoRNPs) play key roles in the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes. How box H/ACA snoRNPs are assembled remains unknown. Here we show that yeast Nhp2p, a core component of these particles, directly binds RNA. In vitro, Nhp2p interacts with high affinity with RNAs containing irregular stem‰ÛÒloop structures but shows weak affinity for poly(A), poly(C) or for double-stranded RNAs. The central region of Nhp2p is believed to function as an RNA-binding domain, since it is related to motifs found in various RNA-binding proteins. Removal of two amino acids that shortens a putative ë_-strand element within Nhp2p central domain impairs the ability of the protein to interact with H/ACA snoRNAs in cell extracts. In vivo, this deletion prevents cell viability and leads to a strong defect in the accumulation of H/ACA snoRNAs and Gar1p. These data suggest that proper direct binding of Nhp2p to H/ACA snoRNAs isåÊrequired for the assembly of H/ACA snoRNPs and hence for the stability of some of their components. In addition, we show that converting a highly conserved glycine residue (G59) within Nhp2p central domain to glutamate significantly reduces cell growth at 30 and 37å¡C. Remarkably, this modification affects the steady-state levels of H/ACA snoRNAs and the strength of Nhp2p association with these RNAs to varying degrees, depending on the nature ofåÊthe H/ACA snoRNA. Finally, we show that theåÊmodified Nhp2p protein whose interaction with H/ACA snoRNAs is impaired cannot accumulate inåÊthe nucleolus, suggesting that only the assembled H/ACA snoRNP particles can be efficiently retained in the nucleolus."
1186,2001,Acetylcholinesterase assay for cerebrospinal fluid using bupivacaine to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase,"BackgroundMost test systems for acetylcholinesterase activity (E.C.3.1.1.7.) are using toxic inhibitors (BW284c51 and iso-OMPA) to distinguish the enzyme from butyrylcholinesterase (E.C.3.1.1.8.) which occurs simultaneously in the cerebrospinal fluid. Applying Ellman's colorimetric method, we were looking for a non-toxic inhibitor to restrain butyrylcholinesterase activity. Based on results of previous in vitro studies bupivacaine emerged to be a suitable inhibitor.ResultsPharmacokinetic investigations with purified cholinesterases have shown maximum inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase activity and minimal interference with acetylcholinesterase activity at bupivacaine final concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 mmol/l. Based on detailed analysis of pharmacokinetic data we developed three equations representing enzyme inhibition at bupivacaine concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mmol/l. These equations allow us to calculate the acetylcholinesterase activity in solutions containing both cholinesterases utilizing the extinction differences measured spectrophotometrically in samples with and without bupivacaine. The accuracy of the bupivacaine-inhibition test could be confirmed by investigations on solutions of both purified cholinesterases and on samples of human cerebrospinal fluid. If butyrylcholinesterase activity has to be assessed simultaneously an independent test using butyrylthiocholine iodide as substrate (final concentration 5 mmol/l) has to be conducted.ConclusionsThe bupivacaine-inhibition test is a reliable method using spectrophotometrical techniques to measure acetylcholinesterase activity in cerebrospinal fluid. It avoids the use of toxic inhibitors for differentiation of acetylcholinesterase from butyrylcholinesterase in fluids containing both enzymes. Our investigations suggest that bupivacaine concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 or 0.5 mmol/l can be applied with the same effect using 1 mmol/l acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate."
1187,2001,Achieving sustainable quality in maternity services ‰ÛÒ using audit of incontinence and dyspareunia to identify shortfalls in meeting standards,"BackgroundSome complications of childbirth (for example, faecal incontinence) are a source of social embarrassment for women, and are often under reported. Therefore, it was felt important to determine levels of complications (against established standards) and to consider obstetric measures aimed at reducing them.MethodsClinical information was collected on 1036 primiparous women delivering at North and South Staffordshire Acute and Community Trusts over a 5-month period in 1997. A questionnaire was sent to 970 women which included self-assessment of levels of incontinence and dyspareunia prior to pregnancy, at 6 weeks post delivery and 9 to 14 months post delivery.ResultsThe response rate was 48%(470/970). Relatively high levels of obstetric interventions were found. In addition, the rates of instrumental deliveries differed between the two hospitals. The highest rates of postnatal symptoms had occurred at 6 weeks, but for many women problems were still present at the time of the survey. At 9‰ÛÒ14 months high rates of dyspareunia (29%(102/347)) and urinary incontinence (35%(133/382)) were reported. Seventeen women (4%) complained of faecal incontinence at this time. Similar rates of urinary incontinence and dyspareunia were seen regardless of mode of delivery.ConclusionFurther work should be undertaken to reduce the obstetric interventions, especially instrumental deliveries. Improvements in a number of areas of care should be undertaken, including improved patient information, improved professional communication and improved professional recognition and management of third degree tears. It is likely that these measures would lead to a reduction in incontinence and dyspareunia after childbirth."
1188,2001,"Acid Glycohydrolases in Rat Spermatocytes, Spermatids and Spermatozoa: Enzyme Activities, Biosynthesis and Immunolocalization","Mammalian sperm acrosome contains several glycohydrolases thought to aid in the dispersion and digestion of vestments surrounding the egg. In this study, we have used multiple approaches to examine the origin of acrosome-associated glycohdyrdolases. Mixed spermatogenic cells, prepared from rat testis, were separated by unit gravity sedimentation. The purified germ cells (spermatocytes [SP], round spermatids [RS], and elongated/condensed spermatids [E/CS]) contained several glycohydrolase activities. Metabolic labeling in the cell culture, immunoprecipitation, and autoradiographic approaches revealed that ë_-D-galactosidase was synthesized in SP and RS in 88/90 kDa forms which undergo processing in a cell-specific manner. Immunohistochemical approaches demonstrated that the enzyme was localized in Golgi membranes/vesicles, and lysosome-like structures in SP and RS, and forming/formed acrosome of E/CS."
1189,2001,A clustering method for repeat analysis in DNA sequences,"BackgroundA computational system for analysis of the repetitive structure of genomic sequences is described. The method uses suffix trees to organize and search the input sequences; this data structure has been used previously for efficient computation of exact and degenerate repeats.ResultsThe resulting software tool collects all repeat classes and outputs summary statistics as well as a file containing multiple sequences (multi fasta), that can be used as the target of searches. Its use is demonstrated here on several complete microbial genomes, the entire Arabidopsis thaliana genome, and a large collection of rice bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences.ConclusionsWe propose a new clustering method for analysis of the repeat data captured in suffix trees. This method has been incorporated into a system that can find repeats in individual genome sequences or sets of sequences, and that can organize those repeats into classes. It quickly and accurately creates repeat databases from small and large genomes. The associated software (RepeatFinder), should prove helpful in the analysis of repeat structure for both complete and partial genome sequences."
1190,2001,A cohort study of possible risk factors for over-reporting of antihypertensive adherence,"BackgroundThe identification of poor medicinal adherence is difficult because direct observation of medication use is usually impractical. Up to 50% of individuals on chronic therapies may not be taking their medication as prescribed. This study is one of the first to explore possible risk factors for over-reporting of antihypertensive adherence using electronic medication monitoring.MethodsThe adherence of 286 individuals on single-drug antihypertensive therapy in a large managed care organization was electronically monitored for approximately three months. Questionnaires on socioeconomic background, adherence to therapy, health beliefs, and social support before and after adherence monitoring were completed. Over-reporting of antihypertensive adherence was assessed by comparing the self-reported frequency of noncompliance with that determined from electronic dosing records. Risk factors for over-reporting were identified by contingency table analysis and step-wise logistic regression.ResultsAlthough only 21% of participants acknowledged missing doses on one or more days per week, electronic monitoring documented nonadherence at this or a higher level in 42% of participants. The following variables were associated with over-reporting: &gt;1 versus 1 daily dose (OR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.50‰ÛÒ4.41; p = .0006), lower perceived health risk from nonadherence (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10‰ÛÒ1.64; p = .0035), and annual household income of &lt;$15,000 versus &gt;$30,000 (OR = 2.64; 95% CI = 1.13‰ÛÒ6.18; p = .025).ConclusionsOver-reporting of adherence may be affected by factors related to dosing frequency, health beliefs and socioeconomic status. This topic deserves further investigation in other patient populations to elucidate possible underlying behavioral explanations."
1191,2001,A combined in vitro / in vivo selection for polymerases with novel promoter specificities,"BackgroundThe DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from T7 bacteriophage (T7 RNAP) has been extensively characterized, and like other phage RNA polymerases it is highly specific for its promoter. A combined in vitro / in vivo selection method has been developed for the evolution of T7 RNA polymerases with altered promoter specificities. Large (103 ‰ÛÒ 106) polymerase libraries were made and cloned downstream of variant promoters. Those polymerase variants that can recognize variant promoters self-amplify both themselves and their attendent mRNAs in vivo. Following RT / PCR amplification in vitro, the most numerous polymerase genes are preferentially cloned and carried into subsequent rounds of selection.Results and ConclusionsA T7 RNA polymerase library that was randomized at three positions was cloned adjacent to a T3-like promoter sequence, and a 'specialist' T7 RNA polymerase was identified. A library that was randomized at a different set of positions was cloned adjacent to a promoter library in which four positions had been randomized, and 'generalist' polymerases that could utilize a variety of T7 promoters were identified, including at least one polymerase with an apparently novel promoter specificity. This method may have applications for evolving other polymerase variants with novel phenotypes, such as the ability to incorporate modified nucleotides."
1192,2001,A comparison on the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their corresponding carcinogenic potencies from a vehicle engine using leaded and lead-free gasoline.,"Our objective in this study was to assess the effect of using two kinds of lead-free gasoline [including 92-lead-free gasoline (92-LFG) and 95-lead-free gasoline (95-LFG), rated according to their octane levels] to replace the use of premium leaded gasoline (PLG) on the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their corresponding benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaP(eq)) amounts from the gasoline-powered engine. The results show that the three gasoline fuels originally contained similar total PAHs and total BaP(eq) contents; however, we found significant differences in the engine exhausts in both contents. The above results suggest that PAHs originally contained in the gasoline fuel did not affect the PAH emissions in the engine exhausts. The emission factors of both total PAHs and total BaP(eq) obtained from the three gasoline fuels shared the same trend: 95-LFG &gt; PLG &gt; 92-LFG. The above result suggests that when PLG was replaced by 95-LFG, the emissions would increase in both total PAHs and total BaP(eq), but when replaced by 92-LFG would lead to the decreased emissions of both contents. By taking emission factors and their corresponding annual gasoline consumption rates into account, we found that both total PAH and total BaP(eq) emissions increased from 1994 to 1999. However, the annual increasing rates in total BaP(eq) emissions were slightly higher than the corresponding increasing rates in total PAHs."
1193,2001,A comprehensive BAC resource,"The Human Genome Project has generated extensive map and sequence data for a large number of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones. In order to maximize the efficient use of the data and to minimize the redundant work for the research community, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) comprehensive BAC resource (cBACr) (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/BacResource/BAC_resource_intro.html) was built as an expansion of the TIGR human BAC ends database. This resource collects, integrates and reports the information on library, maps, sequence, annotation and functions for each human and mouse BAC. The current database contains 635 016 human BACs and 265 617 mouse BACs that were characterized by various approaches, among which 22 705 human clones and 1000 mouse clones have sequence and annotation data."
1194,2001,A computational approach to identify genes for functional RNAs in genomic sequences,"Currently there is no successful computational approach for identification of genes encoding novel functional RNAs (fRNAs) in genomic sequences. We have developed a machine learning approach using neural networks and support vector machines to extract common features among known RNAs for prediction of new RNA genes in the unannotated regions of prokaryotic and archaeal genomes. The Escherichia coli genome was used for development, but we have applied this method to several other bacterial and archaeal genomes. Networks based on nucleotide composition were 80‰ÛÒ90% accurate in jackknife testing experiments for bacteria and 90‰ÛÒ99% for hyperthermophilic archaea. We also achieved a significant improvement in accuracy by combining these predictions with those obtained using a second set of parameters consisting of known RNA sequence motifs and the calculated free energy of folding. Several known fRNAs not included in the training datasets were identified as well as several hundred predicted novel RNAs. These studies indicate that there are many unidentified RNAs in simple genomes that can be predicted computationally as a precursor to experimental study. Public access to our RNA gene predictions and an interface for user predictions is available via the web."
1195,2001,A computational scan for U12-dependent introns in the human genome sequence,"U12-dependent introns are found in small numbers in most eukaryotic genomes, but their scarcity makes accurate characterisation of their properties challenging. A computational search for U12-dependent introns was performed using the draft version of the human genome sequence. Human expressed sequences confirmed 404 U12-dependent introns within the human genome, a 6-fold increase over the total number of non-redundant U12-dependent introns previously identified in all genomes. Although most of these introns had AT-AC or GT-AG terminal dinucleotides, small numbers of introns with a surprising diversity of termini were found, suggesting that many of the non-canonical introns found in the human genome may be variants of U12-dependent introns and, thus, spliced by the minor spliceosome. Comparisons with U2-dependent introns revealed that the U12-dependent intron setåÊlacks the ‰Û÷short intron‰Ûª peak characteristic ofåÊåÊU2-dependent introns. Analysis of this U12-dependent intron set confirmed reports of a biased distribution of U12-dependent introns in the genome and allowed the identification of several alternative splicing events as well as a surprising number of apparent splicing errors. This new larger reference set of U12-dependent introns will serve as a resource for future studies of both the properties and evolution of the U12 spliceosome."
1196,2001,A conditional form of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is sufficient to activate multiple downstream signaling pathways via PLC Gamma 2 in B cells,"BackgroundBruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is essential for B cell development and function. Mutations of Btk elicit X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency in the mouse. Btk has been proposed to participate in B cell antigen receptor-induced signaling events leading to activation of phospholipase C-ë_2 (PLCë_2) and calcium mobilization. However it is unclear whether Btk activation is alone sufficient for these signaling events, and whether Btk can activate additional pathways that do not involve PLCë_2. To address such issues we have generated Btk:ER, a conditionally active form of the kinase, and expressed it in the PLCë_2-deficient DT40 B cell line.ResultsActivation of Btk:ER was sufficient to induce multiple B cell signaling pathways in PLCë_2-sufficient DT40 cells. These included tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCë_2, mobilization of intracellular calcium, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and apoptosis. In DT40 B cells deficient for PLCë_2, Btk:ER activation failed to induce the signaling events described above with the consequence that the cells failed to undergo apoptosis.ConclusionsThese data suggest that Btk:ER regulates downstream signaling pathways primarily via PLCë_2 in B cells. While it is not known whether activated Btk:ER precisely mimics activated Btk, this conditional system will likely facilitate the dissection of the role of Btk and its family members in a variety of biological processes in many different cell types."
1197,2001,Acquisition of tolerance against oxidative damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"BackgroundLiving cells constantly sense and adapt to redox shifts by the induction of genes whose products act to maintain the cellular redox environment. In the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while stationary cells possess a degree of constitutive resistance towards oxidants, treatment of exponential phase cultures with sub-lethal stresses can lead to the transient induction of protection against subsequent lethal oxidant conditions. The sensors of oxidative stress and the corresponding transcription factors that activate gene expression under these conditions have not yet been completely identified.ResultsWe report the role of SOD1, SOD2 and TPS1 genes (which encode the cytoplasmic Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, the mitochondrial Mn-isoform and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, respectively) in the development of resistance to oxidative stress. In all experimental conditions, the cultures were divided into two parts, one was immediately submitted to severe stress (namely: exposure to H2O2, heat shock or ethanol stress) while the other was initially adapted to 40å¡C for 60 min. The deficiency in trehalose synthesis did not impair the acquisition of tolerance to H2O2, but this disaccharide played an essential role in tolerance against heat and ethanol stresses. We also verified that the presence of only one Sodp isoform was sufficient to improve cellular resistance to 5 mM H2O2. On the other hand, while the lack of Sod2p caused high cell sensitivity to ethanol and heat shock, the absence of Sod1p seemed to be beneficial to the process of acquisition of tolerance to these adverse conditions. The increase in oxidation-dependent fluorescence of crude extracts of sod1 mutant cells upon incubation at 40å¡C was approximately 2-fold higher than in sod2 and control strain extracts. Furthermore, in Western blots, we observed that sod mutants showed a different pattern of Hsp104p and Hsp26p expression also different from that in their control strain.ConclusionsTrehalose seemed not to be essential in the acquisition of tolerance to H2O2 stress, but its absence was strongly felt under water stress conditions such as heat and alcoholic stresses. On the other hand, Sod1p could be involved in the control of ROS production; these reactive molecules could signal the induction of genes implicated within cell tolerance to heat and ethanol. The effects of this deletion needs further investigation."
1198,2001,A critical evaluation of differential display as a tool to identify genes involved in legume nodulation: looking back and looking forward,"Screening for differentially expressed genes is a straightforward approach to study the molecular basis of a biological system. In the last 10 years, differential screening technology has evolved rapidly and currently high-throughput tools for genome-wide transcript profiling, such as expressed sequence tags and microarray analysis, are becoming widely available. Here, an overview of this (r)evolution is given with emphasis on the differential display method, which for many years has been the preferred technique of scientists in diverse fields of research. Differential display has also been the method of choice for the identification of genes involved in the symbiotic interaction between Azorhizobium caulinodans and Sesbania rostrata. The advantages with respect to tissue specificity of this particular model system for legume nodulation and the results of a screening for early nodulation-related genes have been considered in the context of transcriptome analyses in other rhizobium‰ÛÒlegume interactions."
1199,2001,A C-terminal hydrophobic region is required for homo-oligomerization of the hepatitis E virus capsid (ORF2) protein,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E, an acute form of viral hepatitis. The open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of HEV encodes the viral capsid protein, which can self-oligomerize into virus-like particles. To understand the domains within this protein important for capsid biogenesis, we have carried out in vitro analyses of association and folding patterns of wild type and mutant ORF2 proteins. When expressed in vitro or in transfected cells, the ORF2 protein assembled as dimers, trimers and higher order forms. While N-terminal deletions up to 111 amino acids had no effect, the deletion of amino acids 585‰ÛÒ610 led to reduced homo-oligomerization. This deletion also resulted in aberrant folding of the protein, as determined by its sensitivity to trypsin. This study suggests that a C-terminal hydrophobic region encompassing amino acids 585‰ÛÒ610 of the ORF2 protein might be critical for capsid biogenesis."
1200,2001,Acting on an environmental health disaster: the case of the Aral Sea.,"The Aral Sea area in Central Asia has been encountering one of the world's greatest environmental disasters for more than 15 years. During that time, despite many assessments and millions of dollars spent by large, multinational organizations, little has changed. The 5 million people living in this neglected and virtually unknown part of the world are suffering not only from an environmental catastrophe that has no easy solutions but also from a litany of health problems. The region is often dismissed as a chronic problem where nothing positive can be achieved. Within this complicated context, Medecins Sans Frontieres, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999, is actively trying to assess the impact of the environmental disaster on human health to help the people who live in the Aral Sea area cope with their environment. Medecins Sans Frontieres has combined a direct medical program to improve the health of the population while conducting operational research to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the environmental disaster and human health outcomes. In this paper we explore the health situation of the region and the broader policy context in which it is situated, and present some ideas that could potentially be applied to many other places in the world that are caught up in environmental and human health disasters."
1201,2002,"13C/12C composition, a novel parameter to study the downward migration of paper sludge in soils‰ÛÊ","ë«13C values of crop and forest soils were measured 8 years after disposal of paper sewage sludge. The carbon transfer from paper sludge downward to the first humic layer is evidenced by a 13C-enrichnient of up to + 5.6‰Û¡ due to the input of 13C-enriched sludge carbonates. 13C/12C composition is thus a novel, sensitive parameter to follow the downward transfer of paper sludge carbon."
1202,2002,13C-Urea breath test threshold calculation and evaluation for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in children,"BackgroundThe 13C-urea breath test (UBT) is performed in adults and children with epigastric pain for non-invasively diagnosing a suspected H. pylori infection. Criteria for UBT interpretation have not been generally agreed on and test reliability has not been established in children of different ages. This study aimed at identifying reliable UBT thresholds in children by using 251 UBTs in conjunction with reference histology and by analyzing 1232 UBTs.MethodsAt baseline and 30 and 60 minutes after the administration of 75 mg 13C-urea to children and adolescents (0.25 to 18 years of age), the differences (ëÓ) of 13CO2/12CO2 ratio in exhaled air (ë«) were determined by mass spectrometry. UBT ëÓë« value thresholds were calculated in random subgroups and evaluated in complementary subgroups using logistic regressions on reference histology or bimodal distribution analyses of ëÓë« values from UBTs alone.ResultsëÓë« values were higher (median, 15.4‰Û¡) in positive (133/251, 53 %) than in negative histology (2.4‰Û¡). At 30 minutes, the calculated cut-off was 5.3‰Û¡ (mean regression determination R2 = 0.91), and sensitivity (0.95), specificity (0.97), positive (0.97) and negative predictive values (0.95) were higher than at 60 minutes (threshold 6.8‰Û¡, R2 = 0.85). Similar thresholds resulted from UBTs analysis (5.8‰Û¡ and 6.2‰Û¡) when sensitivity and specificity were maximized (concordance probabilities, 0.99 and 0.99). There was no systematic age effect.ConclusionsIn children, 13C UBT cut-offs were obtained and specially validated, entailing high accuracy of non-invasively testing for gastric H. pylori infection."
1203,2002,1H NMR determination of base-pair lifetimes in oligonucleotides containing single base mismatches,"Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is employed to characterize the kinetics of base-pair opening in a series of 9mer duplexes containing different single base mismatches. The imino protons from the different mismatched, as well as fully matched, duplexes are assigned from the imino-imino region in the WATERGATE NOESY spectra. The exchange kinetics of the imino protons are measured from selective longitudinal relaxation times. In the limit of infinite exchange catalyst concentration, the exchange times of the mismatch imino protons extrapolate to much shorter lifetimes than are commonly observed for an isolated GC base pair. Different mismatches exhibit different orders of base-pair lifetimes, e.g. a TT mismatch has a shorter base-pair lifetime than a GG mismatch. The effect of the mismatch was observed up to a distance of two neighboring base pairs. This indicates that disruption in the duplex caused by the mismatch is quite localized. The overall order of base-pair lifetimes in the selected sequence context of the base pair is GC &gt; GG &gt; AA &gt; CC &gt; AT &gt; TT. Interestingly, the fully matched AT base pair has a shorter base-pair lifetime relative to many of the mismatches. Thus, in any given base pair, the exchange lifetime can exhibit a strong dependence on sequence context. These findings may be relevant to the way mismatch recognition is accomplished by proteins and small molecules."

The Workshop provided a platform to feast on new technologies and how they have taken research programmes forward. While there will be the inevitable delay during which mechanisms are devised for analysing the huge amount of information generated by these technologies, there is a lot already to look forward to. Highlights included genomic, reverse genomic and proteomic approaches to understanding disease pathogenesis and to identifying new therapeutic targets.

1208,2002,23S rRNA assisted folding of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase is distinctly different from its self-folding,"The role of the 50S particle of Escherichia coli ribosome and its 23S rRNA in the refolding and subunit association of dimeric porcine heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (s-MDH) has been investigated. The self-reconstitution of s-MDH is governed by two parallel pathways representing the folding of the inactive monomeric and the dimeric intermediates. However, in the presence of these folding modulators, only one first order kinetics was observed. To understand whether this involved the folding of the monomers or the dimers, subunit association of s-MDH was studied using fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate‰ÛÒrhodamine-isothiocyanate (FITC‰ÛÒRITC) fluorescence energy transfer and chemical cross-linking with gluteraldehyde. The observation suggests that during refolding the interaction of the unstructured monomers of s-MDH with these ribosomal folding modulators leads to very fast formation of structured monomers that immediately dimerise. These inactive dimers then fold to the native ones, which is the rate limiting step in 23S or 50S assisted refolding of s-MDH. Furthermore, the sequential action of the two fragments of domain V of 23S rRNA has been investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism. The central loop of domain V of 23S rRNA (RNA1) traps the monomeric intermediates, and when they are released by the upper stem‰ÛÒloop region of the domain V of 23S rRNA (RNA2) they are already structured enough to form dimeric intermediates which are directed towards the proper folding pathway."
1209,2002,"2, 4-Diamino-6- hydroxy pyrimidine inhibits NSAIDs induced nitrosyl-complex EPR signals and ulcer in rat jejunum","BackgroundIt has been suggested that one aspect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced intestinal damage is due to either uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or inhibition of electron transport. We investigated the latter possibility using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.ResultsElectron paramagnetic studies of NSAIDS on sub-mitochondrial particles revealed that indomethacin, but not with nabumetone, bound to a site near to Complex I and ubiquinone to generate a radical species. Normal rats exhibited prominent [3Fe-4S]ox signals (g ~ 2.01) at 20 K. One hour after indomethacin there was a prominent, intense and broad absorption pattern at (g ~2.07) suggesting, appearance of radical species overlapping [3Fe-4S]ox and was unaffected by pretreatment with 2,4 diamino -6-hydroxy pyrimidine. At 24 hrs, when macroscopic ulcers were seen, there was a new signal due to a nitric oxide radical (NO‰Û¢). In contrast, nabumetone and 2,4 diamino-6-hydroxy pyrimidine pre-treated animals receiving indomethacin exhibited electron paramagnetic resonance spectra identical to those of controls at 24 hrs and neither was associated with small intestinal ulcers. Indomethacin and 2,4 diamino hydroxy pyrimidine pre-treated rats, but not nabumetone, had increased intestinal permeability.ConclusionThe results suggest that the in vivo effects of indomethacin modulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain directly at 1 h and 24 h through formation of nitric oxide. NO‰Û¢ appears to play an important role in the late pathogenic stages of NSAID enteropathy and may be the site for targeted treatment to reduce their toxicity."
1210,2002,24-hour efficacy of once-daily desloratadine therapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis [ISRCTN32042139],"BackgroundEarly studies with desloratadine demonstrated efficacy in treating seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). A dose-ranging study was conducted to characterize its 24-hour efficacy in patients with SAR.MethodsPatients (N = 1,026) were randomly assigned once-daily (QD) desloratadine (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, or 20 mg) for 2 weeks in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The end point of 24-hour efficacy was assessed by the mean change from baseline in the average AM instantaneous total symptom score (TSS) over the treatment period. Day 2 data were assessed for efficacy of desloratadine following the first dose. Other efficacy variables included AM/PM previous total nasal and nonnasal symptom scores and individual symptom scores.ResultsDesloratadine 5‰ÛÒ20 mg was significantly (P &lt; .01) more effective than placebo in improving total AM instantaneous TSS and AM/PM previous total nasal and nonnasal symptom scores. This dosing range also was significantly (P &lt; .01) more effective than placebo for reducing AM instantaneous TSS beginning with the first dose; thus, demonstrating the full 24-hour efficacy of desloratadine. AM/PM previous scores for all individual symptoms, including nasal congestion, were also significantly improved versus placebo (P &lt; .05) with desloratadine at 5, 7.5, and 20 mg. All treatments were well tolerated. There were no clinically meaningful changes in electrocardiogram parameters.ConclusionDesloratadine 5‰ÛÒ20 mg provided significant 24-hour relief of SAR signs and symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences between the 4 largest doses suggesting that desloratadine 5 mg QD offers the best therapeutic profile for patients with SAR."
1211,2002,3-Chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) and mutagenic activity in Massachusetts drinking water.,"There is limited information on the prevalence of the potent mutagen 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) in U.S. water supplies. We measured MX concentrations and mutagenic activity in tap water samples from 36 surface water systems throughout Massachusetts. We found MX levels much higher (up to 80 ng/L) than previously reported in the United States. We also evaluated the role of water treatment on mutagenic activity and disinfection by-product formation. After adjusting for other covariates, chloramination and filtration were the most important treatment options for reducing mutagenic activity and disinfection by-product formation. Multiple chlorine application (before and after filtration) was associated with increased mutagenicity. Chlorine dose, pH, and total organic carbon were also associated with mutagenicity, MX, and total trihalomethane (TTHM) concentration. Seasonal variation was evident for MX and mutagenic activity, with higher levels occurring in the spring compared to the fall. In contrast, TTHM concentrations were greater in the fall."

Following the reports that two members of the superfamily of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2, were capable of catalyzing the oxidation of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinoic acid with submicromolar Km values, we initiated an investigation of the ability of 4-(N,N-dipropylamino)benzaldehyde (DPAB) to inhibit the oxidation of retinal by purified mouse and human ALDH1A1.ResultsOur results show that DPAB potently inhibits retinal oxidation, with IC50 values of 0.11 and 0.13 ë_M for purified mouse and human ALDH1A1, respectively. Since the HL-60 human myeloid leukemic cell line has been used extensively to study the retinoic acid induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to granulocytes, and ALDH1A1 activity had previously been reported in HL-60 cells, we investigated the ability of DPAB to block differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells exposed to retinal in culture. In HL-60 cells coincubated with 1 ë_M retinal and 50 ë_M DPAB for 144 hours, cell differentiation was inhibited only 30%. Furthermore, the NAD-dependent oxidation of propanal or retinal was less than 0.05 nmoles NADH formed/min-107 cells in spectrophotometric assays using HL-60 cell extracts.ConclusionAlthough ALDH1A1 may be the major catalytic activity for retinal oxidation in some retinoid-dependent mouse and Xenopus embryonic tissues and in adult human and mouse hematopoietic stem cells, another catalytic activity appears to synthesize the retinoic acid ligand necessary to stimulate the differentiation of HL-60 cells to end stage granulocytes."

Recently, the yeast Cdc6 has been reported to have DNA binding activity. Conservation of replication proteins among different species strongly supports their functional similarity. Here we report the results of an investigation into the DNA binding activity of human Cdc6 protein. Cdc6 was expressed and purified from baculovirus infected Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells as GST fusion protein (GST-Cdc6) and its DNA binding activity was tested.ResultsPartially purified fractions containing GSTCdc6 or GST showed an ACS binding activity in an ATP dependent manner. However, further purification revealed the presence of a putative 35 kDa insect cell protein (p35) which was found responsible for the DNA binding activity. A close match to the 9/11 bases of the ARS consensus sequence was sufficient for p35 binding activity. A DNA fragment from the human c-myc origin region containing yeast ACS like elements also showed p35 binding activity.ConclusionsWe have identified a Spodoptera frugiperda protein with ATP dependent DNA binding activity to ACS like elements. ACS like elements have been reported to be essential for ORC binding and replication initiation in yeast but their role in higher eukaryotes still remains elusive. Like the ARS consensus sequence elements of yeast, ACS like elements found in c-myc and lamin beta 2 origin regions may play similar roles in replication and indicate a conserved role for this DNA motif among eukaryotes."
1216,2002,"A49T, V89L and TA repeat polymorphisms of steroid 5ë±-reductase type II and breast cancer risk in Japanese women","BackgroundBreast cancer is hormone related, as are cancers of the endometrium, ovary, and prostate. Several studies have suggested that higher extracellular levels of androgens are associated with breast cancer risk, while biological evidence indicates that androgens are protective. The codon 49 alanine to threonine substitution (A49T), codon 89 valine to leucine substitution (V89L) and TA repeat polymorphisms of the steroid 5ë±-reductase type II (SRD5A2) gene are considered functional with respect to enzyme activity converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. To test the hypothesis that these three polymorphisms are associated with risk of breast cancer, a case‰ÛÒcontrol study was conducted with patients of Aichi Cancer Center Hospital.MethodsThe cases were 237 patients histologically diagnosed with breast cancer, and the controls were 185 noncancer outpatients. DNA from peripheral blood was genotyped by PCR methods.ResultsThe threonine allele of A49T was not found in our subjects. Compared with the V/V genotype of V89L, the L/L genotype was associated with a decreased risk (crude odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36‰ÛÒ1.05). This was also the case for the TA(9/9) genotype, with an OR of 0.58 (95% CI = 0.13‰ÛÒ2.63) relative to TA(0/0). Among women with the TA(0/0) genotype, however, the OR for the L/L genotype was 0.46 (95% CI = 0.24‰ÛÒ0.88) compared with the V/V genotype, and those with the V/V and TA(0/0) genotypes had the highest risk. The haplotype with the L and TA(9) repeat alleles was not found.ConclusionThis study is the first to our knowledge focusing on Japanese women, suggesting that SRD5A2 polymorphisms might have an association with breast cancer risk. Further large-sample studies will be required to confirm the association and to assess any interactions with environmental factors."

1219,2002,A benchmark dose analysis of prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls.,"Benchmark dose (BMD) analysis is used to determine levels of exposure to environmental contaminants associated with increased public health risk. In this study we used a benchmark approach to evaluate the risks associated with prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). We evaluated for intellectual impairment a cohort of children whose prenatal PCB exposure had been assessed from biologic specimens. We calculated BMDs and lower-bound confidence limits (BMDLs) for four end points using four sets of risk criteria. BMDLs were estimated using three different statistical methodologies. The BMDs and BMDLs were remarkably consistent across the four end points for each set of risk criteria, but differed substantially for the different risk criteria. The proportion of the sample considered at risk ranged from 9.8% for the least protective criteria to 74.1% for the most protective. Two methodologies, likelihood ratio and bootstrapping, generated generally similar BMDLs. BMD analysis provides a straightforward, reliable method for evaluating levels of exposure associated with increased public health risk. In the analyses performed in this study, the number of individuals considered at risk depended more on the risk criterion selected than on the outcome assessed."
1220,2002,Aberrant meiotic behavior in Agave tequilana Weber var. azul,"BackgroundAgave tequilana Weber var. azul, is the only one variety permitted by federal law in MÌ©xico to be used for tequila production which is the most popular contemporary alcoholic beverage made from agave and recognized worldwide. Despite the economic, genetic, and ornamental value of the plant, it has not been subjected to detailed cytogenetic research, which could lead to a better understanding of its reproduction for future genetic improvement.The objective of this work was to study the meiotic behavior in pollen mother cells and its implications on the pollen viability in Agave tequilana Weber var. azul.ResultsThe analysis of Pollen Mother Cells in anaphase I (A-I) showed 82.56% of cells with a normal anaphase and, 17.44% with an irregular anaphase. In which 5.28% corresponded to cells with side arm bridges (SAB); 3.68% cells with one bridge and one fragment; 2.58% of irregular anaphase showed cells with one or two lagging chromosomes and 2.95% showed one acentric fragment; cells with two bridges and cells with two bridges and one acentric fragment were observed in frequencies of 1.60% and 1.35% respectively. In anaphase II some cells showed bridges and fragments too. Aberrant A-I cells had many shrunken or empty pollen grains (42.00%) and 58.00 % viable pollen.ConclusionThe observed meiotic irregularities suggest that structural chromosome aberrations have occurred, such as heterozygous inversions, sister chromatid exchanges, deletions and duplications which in turn are reflected in a low pollen viability."

How is it that chemicals and other pollutants such as particulate matter turn up hundreds or even thousands of miles from their sources? These are just two of the questions that a team of American and Canadian scientists hope will be answered using a model they have developed to track pollutants across North America. In the short term, the model's developers are concentrating on using it to assess rates of exposure from food sources, but they hope to expand the model to include global data, a step they hope will help policy makers better understand the consequences of pollution."

The aim of this article is to discuss the best possible way of confirming a bi-directional isthmus conduction (BIC) block after ablation of an isthmus-dependent AFL. A combination of activation and double potential mapping seems to be the most practical way of acutely confirming the BIC block.
1224,2002,"Abnormalities of B cell phenotype, immunoglobulin gene expression and the emergence of autoimmunity in SjÌ¦gren's syndrome","Primary SjÌ¦gren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by specific pathologic features and the production of typical autoantibodies. In addition, characteristic changes in the distribution of peripheral B cell subsets and differences in use of immunoglobulin variable-region genes are also features of pSS. Comparison of B cells from the blood and parotid gland of patients with pSS with those of normal donors suggests that there is a depletion of memory B cells from the peripheral blood and an accumulation or retention of these antigen-experienced B cells in the parotids. Because disordered selection leads to considerable differences in the B cell repertoire in these patients, the delineation of its nature should provide important further clues to the pathogenesis of this autoimmune inflammatory disorder."

We constructed the BPV-1 based vector harbouring the human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene cDNA and tested its ability to restore the function of the LDLR in the receptor-deficient cell line CHO-ldlA7.ResultsThe introduced vector p3.7LDL produced functionally active LDL receptors in the receptor-deficient cell line CHO-ldlA7 during the 32-week period of observation as determined by the internalisation assay with the labelled LDL particles.ConclusionBovine papillomavirus type-1 (BPV-1)-derived vectors could be suitable for gene therapy due to their episomal maintenance at intermediate to high copy number and stable, high-level expression of the gene products. The constructed BPV-1 based vector p3.7LDL produced functionally active LDL receptors in the LDLR-deficient cell line CHO-ldlA7 during the 32-week period of observation.In vivo experiments should reveal, whether 1‰ÛÒ5% transfection efficiency obtained in the current work is sufficient to bring about detectable and clinically significant lowering of the amount of circulating LDL cholesterol particles."

1227,2002,Absence of p53 in Clara cells favours multinucleation and loss of cell cycle arrest,"BackgroundThe p53 oncosuppressor protein is a critical mediator of the response to injury in mammalian cells and is mutationally inactivated in the majority of lung malignancies. In this analysis, the effects of p53-deficiency were investigated in short-term primary cultures of murine bronchiolar Clara cells. Clara cells, isolated from gene-targeted p53-deficient mice, were compared to cells derived from wild type littermates.Resultsp53 null cultures displayed abnormal morphology; specifically, a high incidence of multinucleation, which increased with time in culture. Multinucleated cells were proficient in S phase DNA synthesis, as determined by BrdU incorporation. However, multinucleation did not reflect altered rates of S phase synthesis, which were similar between wild type and p53-/- cultures. Nucleation defects in p53-/- Clara cells associated with increased centrosome number, as determined by confocal microscopy of pericentrin-stained cultures, and may highlight a novel role of p53 in preserving genomic integrity in lung epithelial cells. Effects of p53-deficiency were also studied following exposure to DNA damage. A p53-dependent reduction in the BrdU index was observed in Clara cells following ionizing radiation. The reduction in BrdU index in wild type cells displayed serum-dependency, and occurred only in the absence of serum. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that in murine primary Clara cell culture, cell cycle arrest is a p53-mediated response to DNA damage, and that extracellular factors, such as serum, influence this response.ConclusionThese findings highlight functions of wild type p53 protein in bipolar spindle formation, centrosome regulation, and growth control in bronchiolar Clara cells."
1228,2002,Absence of Telomerase Activity in Malignant Bone Tumors and Soft-Tissue Sarcomas,"Purpose: Telomerase activity appears to play a crucial role in the development of many tumors. More than 80% of all malignant human tumors show an increased telomerase activity. However, conflicting results have been reported about telomerase activity in sarcomas. The aim of the study was to obtain more information about telomerase activity in sarcomas based on a large number of cases. Methods: Telomerase activity was measured in 69 different tumor samples (33 malignant bone tumors and 36 soft tissue sarcomas). Tumor samples were obtained intraoperatively and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Telomerase activity was detected by the telomeric repeat amplification assay (TRAP-assay). Results: Only 7% of the samples showed telomerase activity. No correlation between staging and telomerase activity could be observed. Discussion: The fact that only five out of 69 examined tumor samples showed a telomerase activity provides experimental evidence that in sarcomas the reactivation of telomerase may play a subordinate role. Our results suggest that alternative mechanisms for cell immortalization, yet to be determined, seem to be involved in the development and/or maintenance of soft-tissue sarcomas and malignant bone tumors."

Here, we describe an unusual mammalian pseudouridylation guide RNA, called U93, that is composed of two tandemly arranged box H/ACA RNA domains. The U93 RNA therefore carries two H and two ACA box motifs, all of which are essential for accumulation of the full-length RNA. The human U93 RNA accumulates in Cajal (coiled) bodies and it is predicted to function in pseudouridylation of the U2 spliceosomal snRNA. Our results lend further support to the notion that modification of the RNA polymerase II-transcribed spliceosomal snRNAs takes place in Cajal bodies."

1235,2002,"Accumulation of dehydrin-like proteins in the mitochondria of cereals in response to cold, freezing, drought and ABA treatment","BackgroundDehydrins are known as Group II late embryogenesis abundant proteins. Their high hydrophilicity and thermostability suggest that they may be structure stabilizers with detergent and chaperone-like properties. They are localised in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. We have recently found putative dehydrins in the mitochondria of some cereals in response to cold. It is not known whether dehydrin-like proteins accumulate in plant mitochondria in response to stimuli other than cold stress.ResultsWe have found five putative dehydrins in the mitochondria of winter wheat, rye and maize seedlings. Two of these polypeptides had the same molecular masses in all three species (63 and 52 kD) and were thermostable. Drought, freezing, cold, and exogenous ABA treatment led to higher accumulation of dehydrin-like protein (dlp) 63 kD in the rye and wheat mitochondria. Protein 52 kD was induced by cold adaptation and ABA. Some accumulation of these proteins in the maize mitochondria was found after cold exposition only. The other three proteins appeared to be heat-sensitive and were either slightly induced or not induced at all by all treatments used.ConclusionsWe have found that, not only cold, but also drought, freezing and exogenous ABA treatment result in accumulation of the thermostable dehydrins in plant mitochondria. Most cryotolerant species such as wheat and rye accumulate more heat-stable dehydrins than cryosensitive species such as maize. It has been supposed that their function is to stabilize proteins in the membrane or in the matrix. Heat-sensitive putative dehydrins probably are not involved in the stress reaction and adaptation of plants."
1236,2002,Accuracy and calibration of commercial oligonucleotide and custom cDNA microarrays,"We compared the accuracy of microarray measurements obtained with oligonucleotide arrays (GeneChip, Affymetrix) with a laboratory-developed cDNA array by assaying test RNA samples from an experiment using a paradigm known to regulate many genes measured on both arrays. We selected 47 genes represented on both arrays, including both known regulated and unregulated transcripts, and established reference relative expression measurements for these genes in the test RNA samples using quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (QRTPCR) assays. The validity of the reproducible (average coefficient of variation = 11.8%) QRTPCR measurements were established through application of a new mathematical model. The performance of both array platforms in identifying regulated and non-regulated genes was identical. With either platform, 16 of 17 definitely regulated genes were correctly identified, and no definitely unregulated transcript was falsely identified as regulated. Accuracy of the fold-change measurements obtained with each platform was assessed by determining measurement bias. Both platforms consistently underestimate the relative changes in mRNA expression between experimental and control samples. The bias observed with cDNA arrays was predictable for fold-changes &lt;250-fold by QRTPCR and could be corrected by the calibration function Fc = Fa(cDNA)q, where Fa(cDNA) is the microarray-determined fold-change comparing experimental with control samples, q is the correction factor and Fc is the calibrated value. The bias observed with the commercial oligonucleotide arrays was less predictable and calibration was unfeasible. Following calibration, fold-change measurements generated by custom cDNA arrays were more accurate than those obtained by commercial oligonucleotide arrays. Our study demonstrates systematic bias of microarray measurements and identifies a calibration function that improves the accuracy of cDNA array data."
1237,2002,Accuracy of five different diagnostic techniques in mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) compared with the diagnosis of PID made by laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, and cervical and endometrial cultures. Study design: A diagnostic performance test study was carried out by cross-sectional analysis in 61 women. A group presenting PID (n = 31) was compared with a group (n = 30) presenting another cause for non-specific lower abdominal pain (NSLAP). Diagnosis provided by an evaluated method was compared with a standard diagnosis (by surgical findings, histopathology, and microbiology). The pathologist was unaware of the visual findings and presumptive diagnoses given by other methods. RESULTS: All clinical and laboratory PID criteria showed low discrimination capacity. Adnexal tenderness showed the greatest sensitivity. Clinical diagnosis had 87% sensitivity, while laparoscopy had 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity; transvaginal ultrasound had 30% sensitivity and 67% specificity; and endometrial culture had 83% sensitivity and 26% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical criteria represent the best diagnostic method for discriminating PID. Laparoscopy showed the best specificity and is thus useful in those cases having an atypical clinical course for discarding abdominal pain when caused by another factor. The other diagnostic methods might have limited use."
1238,2002,Accuracy of prognosis estimates by four palliative care teams: a prospective cohort study,"BackgroundPrognosis estimates are used to access services, but are often inaccurate. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of giving a prognosis range.Methods and measurementsA prospective cohort study in four multi-professional palliative care teams in England collected data on 275 consecutive cancer referrals who died. Prognosis estimates (minimum ‰ÛÒ maximum) at referral, patient characteristics, were recorded by staff, and later compared with actual survival.ResultsMinimum survival estimates ranged &lt;1 to 364 days, maximum 7 ‰ÛÒ 686 days. Mean patient survival was 71 days (range 1 ‰ÛÒ 734). In 42% the estimate was accurate, in 36% it was over optimistic and in 22% over pessimistic. When the minimum estimate was less than 14 days accuracy increased to 70%. Accuracy was related, in multivariate analysis, to palliative care team and (of borderline significance) patient age.ConclusionsOffering a prognosis range has higher levels of accuracy (about double) than traditional estimates, but is still very often inaccurate, except very close to death. Where possible clinicians should discuss scenarios with patients, rather than giving a prognosis range."
1239,2002,Accuracy of responses from postal surveys about continuing medical education and information behavior: experiences from a survey among German diabetologists,BackgroundPostal surveys are a popular instrument for studies about continuing medical education habits. But little is known about the accuracy of responses in such surveys. The objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude of inaccurate responses in a postal survey among physicians.MethodsA sub-analysis of a questionnaire about continuing medical education habits and information management was performed. The five variables used for the quantitative analysis are based on a question about the knowledge of a fictitious technical term and on inconsistencies in contingency tables of answers to logically connected questions.ResultsResponse rate was 52%. Non-response bias is possible but seems not very likely since an association between demographic variables and inconsistent responses could not be found. About 10% of responses were inaccurate according to the definition.ConclusionIt was shown that a sub-analysis of a questionnaire makes a quantification of inaccurate responses in postal surveys possible. This sub-analysis revealed that a notable portion of responses in a postal survey about continuing medical education habits and information management was inaccurate.

1241,2002,Acetaminophen poisoning: an update for the intensivist,"Acetaminophen overdose is common and can result from deliberate/nonstaggered or accidental/staggered ingestion. Patients presenting within 24 h of an acetaminophen overdose can safely be managed on medical wards. Early management of nonstaggered overdose is guided by the plasma acetaminophen concentration, whereas management of accidental/staggered ingestion is guided by ingested dose. Ingested dose and time from ingestion to presentation are important prognostic factors in accidental/staggered ingestion. Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (ALF) requires meticulous supportive care in an intensive care unit (ICU), with early identification and transfer of patients who are likely to require liver transplantation to a specialist liver centre. The modified King's College Hospital criteria (incorporating lactate into the traditional criteria) represent the best tool for identifying patients who require transplantation."
1242,2002,Acetaminophen toxicity: suicidal vs accidental,"IntroductionAcetaminophen toxicity, which can lead to hepatotoxicity, is a burden on our health care system and contributes significantly to intensive care unit admissions and cost of hospitalization. The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiology of various types of acetaminophen poisoning and analyze their outcome compared with their admission characteristics.MethodsWe identified 93 consecutive patients, hospitalized for acetaminophen toxicity over a 52-month period from 1996 to 1999 in our urban county hospital. Retrospective case-control analysis was carried out using the data obtained from the medical records.ResultsAcetaminophen accounted for 7.5% of all cases of poisoning admitted during this period. Of the 93 patients, 80 were classified as suicidal and 13 had accidentally poisoned themselves in an attempt to relieve pain. The ratio of females to males was found to be 2:1. Of the 93 patients studied, 88 were admitted to the intensive care unit for initial 24‰ÛÒ48 hours of monitoring. Peak acetaminophen levels were higher in the suicidal overdose group (mean 121.7 å± 97.0 mg/l vs 64.5 å± 61.8 mg/l, P &lt; 0.05) than in the accidental group. In spite of this, peak aminotransferase levels &gt;1000 IU/l were more often seen in the latter (39% vs 12%, P &lt; 0.05). Hepatic coma and death were seen more often in the accidental overdose group (15% vs 0%, P &lt; 0.05). Interestingly chronic alcohol abuse was also more frequent in the accidental overdose category (39% vs 18%, P = 0.05).DiscussionAlthough the peak acetaminophen level in the suicidal group was significantly higher, cases of therapeutic misadventure had higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Peak acetaminophen levels correlate poorly with hepatic dysfunction, morbidity and mortality.ConclusionWe recommend that the patients with suicidal acetaminophen overdose, without any concomitant poisoning, can safely managed on the medical floors."
1243,2002,A child with chronic manganese exposure from drinking water.,"The patient's family bought a home in a suburb, but the proximity of the house to wetlands and its distance from the town water main prohibited connecting the house to town water. The family had a well drilled and they drank the well water for 5 years, despite the fact that the water was turbid, had a metallic taste, and left an orange-brown residue on clothes, dishes, and appliances. When the water was tested after 5 years of residential use, the manganese concentration was elevated (1.21 ppm; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reference, &lt; 0.05 ppm). The family's 10-year-old son had elevated manganese concentrations in whole blood, urine, and hair. The blood manganese level of his brother was normal, but his hair manganese level was elevated. The patient, the 10-year-old, was in the fifth grade and had no history of learning problems; however, teachers had noticed his inattentiveness and lack of focus in the classroom. Our results of cognitive testing were normal, but tests of memory revealed a markedly below-average performance: the patient's general memory index was at the 13th percentile, his verbal memory at the 19th percentile, his visual memory at the 14th percentile, and his learning index at the 19th percentile. The patient's free recall and cued recall tests were all 0.5-1.5 standard deviations (1 SD = 16th percentile) below normal. Psychometric testing scores showed normal IQ but unexpectedly poor verbal and visual memory. These findings are consistent with the known toxic effects of manganese, although a causal relationship cannot necessarily be inferred."

1245,2002,A chromosomal position effect on gene targeting in human cells,"We describe gene targeting experiments involving a human cell line (RAN10) containing, in addition to its endogenous alleles, two ectopic alleles of the interferon-inducible gene 6‰ÛÒ16. The frequency of gene targeting at one of the ectopic 6‰ÛÒ16 alleles (H3.7) was 34-fold greater than the combined frequency of gene targeting involving endogenous 6-16 alleles in RAN10. Preference for H3.7 was maintained when the target loci in RAN10 were transcriptionally activated by interferon. Despite the 34-fold preference for H3.7, the absolute gene targeting efficiency in RAN10 was only 3-fold higher than in the parental HT1080 cell line. These data suggest that different alleles can compete with each other, and perhaps with non-homologous loci, in a step which is necessary, but not normally rate-limiting, for gene targeting. The efficiency of this step can therefore be more sensitive to chromosomal position effects than the rate-determining steps for gene targeting. The nature of the position effects involved remains unknown but does not correlate with transcription status, which in our system has a very modest influence on the frequency of gene targeting. In summary, our work unequivocally identifies a position effect on gene targeting in human cells."

1247,2002,A combined analysis of the short-term effects of photochemical air pollutants on mortality within the EMECAM project.,"In recent years, some epidemiologic studies have attributed adverse effects of air pollutants on health not only to particles and sulfur dioxide but also to photochemical air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and ozone). The effects are usually small, leading to some inconsistencies in the results of the studies. Furthermore, the different methodologic approaches of the studies used has made it difficult to derive generic conclusions. We provide here a quantitative summary of the short-term effects of photochemical air pollutants on mortality in seven Spanish cities involved in the EMECAM project, using generalized additive models from analyses of single and multiple pollutants. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone data were provided by seven EMECAM cities (Barcelona, GijÌ_n, Huelva, Madrid, Oviedo, Seville, and Valencia). Mortality indicators included daily total mortality from all causes excluding external causes, daily cardiovascular mortality, and daily respiratory mortality. Individual estimates, obtained from city-specific generalized additive Poisson autoregressive models, were combined by means of fixed effects models and, if significant heterogeneity among local estimates was found, also by random effects models. Significant positive associations were found between daily mortality (all causes and cardiovascular) and NO(2), once the rest of air pollutants were taken into account. A 10 microg/m(3) increase in the 24-hr average 1-day NO(2)level was associated with an increase in the daily number of deaths of 0.43% [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.003-0.86%] for all causes excluding external. In the case of significant relationships, relative risks for cause-specific mortality were nearly twice as much as that for total mortality for all the photochemical pollutants. Ozone was independently related only to cardiovascular daily mortality. No independent statistically significant relationship between photochemical air pollutants and respiratory mortality was found. The results in this study suggest that, given the present levels of photochemical pollutants, people living in Spanish cities are exposed to health risks derived from air pollution."
1248,2002,A common reference for cDNA microarray hybridizations,"Comparisons of expression levels across different cDNA microarray experiments are easier when a common reference is co-hybridized to every microarray. Often this reference consists of one experimental control sample, a pool of cell lines or a mix of all samples to be analyzed. We have developed an alternative common reference consisting of a mix of the products that are spotted on the array. Pooling part of the cDNA PCR products before they are printed and their subsequent amplification towards either sense or antisense cRNA provides an excellent common reference. Our results show that this reference yields a reproducible hybridization signal in 99.5% of the cDNA probes spotted on the array. Accordingly, a ratio can be calculated for every spot, and expression levels across different hybridizations can be compared. In dye-swap experiments this reference shows no significant ratio differences, with 95% of the spots within an interval of å±0.2-fold change. The described method can be used in hybridizations with both amplified and non-amplified targets, is time saving and provides a constant batch of common reference that lasts for thousands of hybridizations."
1249,2002,A comparative genomic method for computational identification of prokaryotic translation initiation sites,"The ever growing number of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes facilitates cross-species comparisons by genomic annotation algorithms. This paper introduces a new probabilistic framework for comparative genomic analysis and demonstrates its utility in the context of improving the accuracy of prokaryotic gene start site detection. Our frame work employs a product hidden Markov model (PROD-HMM) with state architecture to model the species-specific trinucleotide frequency patterns in sequences immediately upstream and downstream of a translation start site and to detect the contrasting non-synonymous (amino acid changing) and synonymous (silent) substitution rates that differentiate prokaryotic coding from intergenic regions. Depending on the intricacy of the features modeled by the hidden state architecture, intergenic, regulatory, promoter and coding regions can be delimited by this method. The new system is evaluated using a preliminary set of orthologous Pyrococcus gene pairs, for which it demonstrates an improved accuracy of detection. Its robustness is confirmed by analysis with cross-validation of an experimentally verified set of Escherichia coli K-12 and Salmonella thyphimurium LT2 orthologs. The novel architecture has a number of attractive features that distinguish it from previous comparative models such as pair-HMMs."
1250,2002,A comparative study of gallstones from children and adults using FTIR spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy,"BackgroundCholelithiasis is the gallstone disease (GSD) where stones are formed in the gallbladder. The main function of the gallbladder is to concentrate bile by the absorption of water and sodium. GSD has high prevalence among elderly adults. There are three major types of gallstones found in patients, White, Black and Brown. The major chemical component of white stones is cholesterol. Black and brown stones contain different proportions of cholesterol and bilirubin. The pathogenesis of gallstones is not clearly understood. Analysis of the chemical composition of gallstones using various spectroscopic techniques offers clues to the pathogenesis of gallstones. Recent years has seen an increasing trend in the number of cases involving children. The focus of this study is on the analysis of the chemical composition of gallstones from child and adult patients using spectroscopic methods.MethodsIn this report, we present FTIR spectroscopic studies and fluorescence microscopic analysis of gallstones obtained from 67 adult and 21 child patients. The gallstones were removed during surgical operations at Soroka University Medical Center.ResultsOur results show that black stones from adults and children are rich in bilirubin. Brown stones are composed of varying amounts of bilirubin and cholesterol. Green stones removed from an adult, which is rare, was found to be composed mainly of cholesterol. Our results also indicated that cholesterol and bilirubin could be the risk factors for gallstone formation in adults and children respectively. Fluorescence micrographs showed that the Ca-bilirubinate was present in all stones in different quantities and however, Cu-bilirubinate was present only in the mixed and black stones.ConclusionsAnalysis based on FTIR suggest that the composition of black and brown stones from both children and adults are similar. Various layers of the brown stone from adults differ by having varying quantities of cholesterol and calcium carbonate. Ring patterns observed mainly in the green stone using fluorescence microscopy have relevance to the mechanism of the stone formation. Our preliminary study suggests that bilirubin and cholesterol are the main risk factors of gallstone disease."

1254,2003,17ë_-Estradiol responsiveness of MCF-7 laboratory strains is dependent on an autocrine signal activating the IGF type I receptor,"BackgroundHuman MCF-7 cells have been studied extensively as a model for breast cancer cell growth. Many reports have established that serum-starved MCF-7 cells can be induced to proliferate upon the sole addition of 17ë_-estradiol (E2). However, the extent of the mitogenic response to E2 varies in different MCF-7 strains and may even be absent. In this study we compared the E2-sensitivity of three MCF-7 laboratory strains.ResultsThe MCF-7S line is non-responsive to E2, the MCF-7 ATCC has an intermediate response to E2, while the MCF-7 NKI is highly E2-sensitive, although the levels and activities of the estrogen receptor (ER) are not significantly different. Both suramin and IGF type I receptor blocking antibodies are able to inhibit the mitogenic response to E2-treatment in MCF-7 ATCC and MCF-7 NKI cells. From this we conclude that E2-induced proliferation is dependent on IGF type I receptor activation in all three MCF-7 strains.ConclusionsThe results presented in this article suggest that E2-responsiveness of MCF-7 cells is dependent on the secretion of an autocrine factor activating the IGF-IR. All three strains of MCF-7 breast cancer cells investigated do not respond to E2 if the IGF-RI-pathway is blocked. Generally, breast cancer therapy is targeted at inhibiting estrogen action. This study suggests that inhibition of IGF-action in combination with anti-estrogen-treatment may provide a more effective way in treatment or even prevention of breast cancer."
1255,2003,"25th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, San Antonio, Texas, USA, 10‰ÛÒ14 December 2002 Update on clinical research","The Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium has become a key forum for the presentation and discussion of both translational scientific aspects as well as clinical aspects of breast cancer care. In this report of the 25th Annual Meeting, an update of the salient clinical data is presented. The findings of the CALGB 9741 trial, an updated analysis of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination study, and other significant paper and poster presentations are discussed. Summaries are also given of the clinical plenary lectures and minisymposia on adjuvant therapy and aromatase inhibitors."
1256,2003,"25th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, San Antonio, Texas, USA, 10‰ÛÒ14 December 2002 Update on preclinical and translational research","The Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium is one of the largest regular conferences devoted to breast cancer research and treatment. In particular, it provides a forum in which to discuss the more translational aspects of current basic research, and the 2002 meeting was no exception. Growth factor pathways and endocrine resistance, cancer genomics and the clinical applications of proteomics were three of the major topics for discussion. Presentations on genetic susceptibility and the development of prognostic and predictive markers also created much interest."
1257,2003,3‰Û_-Exonuclease resistance of DNA oligodeoxynucleotides containing O6-[4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butyl]guanine,"Tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), is a chemical carcinogen thought to be involved in the initiation of lung cancer in smokers. NNK is metabolically activated to methylating and pyridyloxobutylating species that form promutagenic adducts with DNA nucleobases, e.g. O6-[4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butyl]guanine (O6-POB-dG). O6-POB-dG is a strongly mispairing DNA lesion capable of inducing both G‰ ÕA and G‰ ÕT base changes, suggesting its importance in NNK mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Our earlier investigations have identified the ability of O6-POB-dG to hinder DNA digestion by snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPDE), a 3‰Û_-exonuclease commonly used for DNA ladder sequencing and as a model enzyme to test nuclease sensitivity of anti-sense oligonucleotide drugs. We now extend our investigation to three other enzymes possessing 3‰Û_-exonuclease activity: bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and E.coli exonuclease III. Our results indicate that, unlike SVPDE, 3‰Û_-exonuclease activities of these three enzymes are not blocked by O6-POB-dG lesion. Conformational analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of DNA containing O6-POB-dG suggest that the observed resistance of the O6-POB-dG lesion to SVPDE-catalyzed hydrolysis may result from the structural changes in the DNA strand induced by the O6-POB group, including C3‰Û_-endo sugar puckering and the loss of stacking interaction between the pyridyloxobutylated guanine and its flanking bases. In contrast, O6-methylguanine lesion used as a control does not induce similar structural changes in DNA and does not prevent its digestion by SVPDE."
1258,2003,3‰Û_-Modified oligonucleotides by reverse DNA synthesis,"Reverse DNA oligonucleotide synthesis (i.e. from 5‰Û_‰ Õ3‰Û_) is a strategy that has yet to be exploited fully. While utilized previously for the construction of alternating 3‰Û_-3‰Û_- and 5‰Û_-5‰Û_-linked antisense oligonucleotides, the use of nucleoside 5‰Û_-phosphoramidites has not generally been used for the elaboration of (modified) oligonucleotides. Presently, the potential of reverse oligonucleotide synthesis for the facile synthesis of 3‰Û_-modified DNAs is illustrated using a phosphoramidite derived from tyrosine. The derived oligonucleotide was shown to have chromatographic and electrophoretic properties identical with the modified oligonucleotide resulting from the proteinase K digestion of the vaccinia topoisomerase I‰ÛÒDNA covalent complex. The results confirm the nature of the structure previously assigned to this product, and establish the facility with which proteinase K is able to complete the digestion of the polypeptide backbone of the DNA oligonucleotide-linked topoisomerase I."
1259,2003,"3DNA: a software package for the analysis, rebuilding and visualization of three-dimensional nucleic acid structures","We present a comprehensive software package, 3DNA, for the analysis, reconstruction and visualization of three-dimensional nucleic acid structures. Starting from a coordinate file in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, 3DNA can handle antiparallel and parallel double helices, single-stranded structures, triplexes, quadruplexes and other complex tertiary folding motifs found in both DNA and RNA structures. The analysis routines identify and categorize all base interactions and classify the double helical character of appropriate base pair steps. The program makes use of a recently recommended reference frame for the description of nucleic acid base pair geometry and a rigorous matrix-based scheme to calculate local conformational parameters and rebuild the structure from these parameters. The rebuilding routines produce rectangular block representations of nucleic acids as well as full atomic models with the sugar‰ÛÒphosphate backbone and publication quality ‰Û÷standardized‰Ûª base stacking diagrams. Utilities are provided to locate the base pairs and helical regions in a structure and to reorient structures for effective visualization. Regular helical models based on X-ray diffraction measurements of various repeating sequences can also be generated within the program."
1260,2003,3matrix and 3motif: a protein structure visualization system for conserved sequence motifs,"Computational methods such as sequence alignment and motif construction are useful in grouping related proteins into families, as well as helping to annotate new proteins of unknown function. These methods identify conserved amino acids in protein sequences, but cannot determine the specific functional or structural roles of conserved amino acids without additional study. In this work, we present 3matrix (http://3matrix.stanford.edu) and 3motif (http://3motif.stanford.edu), a web-based sequence motif visualization system that displays sequence motif information in its appropriate three-dimensional (3D) context. This system is flexible in that users can enter sequences, keywords, structures or sequence motifs to generate visualizations. In 3motif, users can search using discrete sequence motifs such as PROSITE patterns, emotifs, or any other regular expression-like motif. Similarly, 3matrix accepts an ematrix position-specific scoring matrix, or will convert a multiple sequence alignment block into an ematrix for visualization. Each query motif is used to search the protein structure database for matches, in which the motif is then visually highlighted in three dimensions. Important properties of motifs such as sequence conservation and solvent accessible surface area are also displayed in the visualizations, using carefully chosen color shading schemes."

While all of the basic biology presented at this meeting may potentially contribute to breast cancer research, there were a significant number of presentations and posters directly pertinent to this field. Here we have summarized the research that is of greatest immediate relevance to breast cancer, with particular emphasis on mammary gland development and tumorigenesis in vivo, three-dimensional in vitro models of mammary morphogenesis, alterations of signal transduction pathways in breast cancer, and global studies in expression profiling and drug screening."
1262,2003,4-Aminopyridine Decreases Progesterone Production by Porcine Granulosa Cells,"BackgroundIon channels occur as large families of related genes with cell-specific expression patterns. Granulosa cells have been shown to express voltage-gated potassium channels from more than one family. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), an antagonist of KCNA but not KCNQ channels.MethodsGranulosa cells were isolated from pig follicles and cultured with 4-AP, alone or in combination with FSH, 8-CPT-cAMP, estradiol 17ë_, and DIDS. Complimentary experiments determined the effects of 4-AP on the spontaneously established pig granulosa cell line PGC-2. Granulosa cell or PGC-2 function was assessed by radio-immunoassay of media progesterone accumulation. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Drug-induced changes in cell membrane potential and intracellular potassium concentration were documented by spectrophotometric determination of DiBAC4(3) and PBFI fluorescence, respectively. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) was assessed by immunoblotting. Flow cytometry was also used to examine granulosa cell viability and size.Results4-AP (2 mM) decreased progesterone accumulation in the media of serum-supplemented and serum-free granulosa cultures, but inhibited cell proliferation only under serum-free conditions. 4-AP decreased the expression of StAR, the production of cAMP and the synthesis of estradiol by PGC-2. Addition of either 8-CPT-cAMP or estradiol 17ë_ to serum-supplemented primary cultures reduced the inhibitory effects of 4-AP. 4-AP treatment was also associated with increased cell size, increased intracellular potassium concentration, and hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential. The drug-induced hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential was prevented either by decreasing extracellular chloride or by adding DIDS to the media. DIDS also prevented 4-AP inhibition of progesterone production.Conclusion4-AP inhibits basal and FSH-stimulated progesterone production by pig granulosa cells via drug action at multiple interacting steps in the steroidogenic pathway. These inhibitory effects of 4-AP on steroidogenesis may reflect drug-induced changes in intracellular concentrations of K+and Cl- as well as granulosa cell resting membrane potential."

1264,2003,"8-Hydroxyguanine in a mutational hotspot of the c-Ha-ras gene causes misreplication, ‰Û÷action-at-a-distance‰Ûª mutagenesis and inhibition of replication","Mutations in particular codons of c-Ha-ras have a strong activating potential, and an activated ras oncogene has been found in a number of human cancers. Using fragments of the human c-Ha-ras gene containing 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-G) in codon 12, we provide evidence for highly complex biochemical events leading to activation of the oncogene. Replication with DNA polymerases ë± (Polë±) and ë_ (Polë_) led to misincorporation of dAMP, while DNA polymerase ëá (Polëá) caused additional insertion of dGMP. For the first time we report an ‰Û÷action-at-a-distance‰Ûª mutagenic effect for Polëá. Replication catalyzed by this enzyme resulted in misincorporating dAMP, dTMP and dGMP opposite non-oxidized guanine 3‰Û_-flanked by 8-OH-G. Interestingly, two adjacent 8-OH-G residues greatly relaxed the specificity of Polëá, which in this system was able to incorporate all four nucleotides. Moreover, two adjacent 8-OH-G residues completely blocked Polë± and strongly inhibited Polë_, whereas Polëá was entirely resistant to this inhibition. These results suggest an important role for Polëá in inducing hypermutability in codon 12. Our observations are important for understanding the consequences of 8-OH-G being positioned within the mutational hot spots of oncogenes, the outcome of which appears to be relatively complex even in minimal in vitro systems."

Begun 25 years ago, this meeting was initially held every 4 years, but therapeutic progress, new strategies and provocative trials data have accelerated to the extent that conferences are now held biennially. The meeting this year was attended by almost 3000 delegates. Major topics included new prognostic and predictive markers in early breast cancer, the best use of adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and innovations in local surgery and radiation therapy."
1266,2003,A 2-year dose-response study of lesion sequences during hepatocellular carcinogenesis in the male B6C3F(1) mouse given the drinking water chemical dichloroacetic acid.,"Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is carcinogenic to the B6C3F(1) mouse and the F344 rat. Given the carcinogenic potential of DCA in rodent liver and the known concentrations of this compound in drinking water, reliable biologically based models to reduce the uncertainty of risk assessment for human exposure to DCA are needed. Development of such models requires identification and quantification of premalignant hepatic lesions, identification of the doses at which these lesions occur, and determination of the likelihood that these lesions will progress to cancer. In this study we determined the dose response of histopathologic changes occurring in the livers of mice exposed to DCA (0.05-3.5 g/L) for 26-100 weeks. Lesions were classified as foci of cellular alteration smaller than one liver lobule (altered hepatic foci; AHF), foci of cellular alteration larger than one liver lobule (large foci of cellular alteration; LFCA), adenomas (ADs), or carcinomas (CAs). Histopathologic analysis of 598 premalignant lesions revealed that (a)) each lesion class had a predominant phenotype; (b)) AHF, LFCA, and AD demonstrated neoplastic progression with time; and (c)) independent of DCA dose and length of exposure effects, some toxic/adaptive changes in non-involved liver were related to this neoplastic progression. A lesion sequence for carcinogenesis in male B6C3F(1) mouse liver has been proposed that will enable development of a biologically based mathematical model for DCA. Because all classes of premalignant lesions and CAs were found at both lower and higher doses, these data are consistent with the conclusion that nongenotoxic mechanisms, such as negative selection, are relevant to DCA carcinogenesis at lower doses where DCA genotoxicity has not been observed."
1267,2003,ABFAB. Attachment to the breast and family attitudes to breastfeeding. The effect of breastfeeding education in the middle of pregnancy on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding: a randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN21556494],"BackgroundIt has proven difficult to reach World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations that infants be exclusively breastfed from birth to six months of age [1,2], yet there is limited knowledge about interventions that are effective in increasing breastfeeding initiation and duration. Particularly lacking is evidence about how to maintain breastfeeding rates in countries which already have a high initiation of breastfeeding. This study aims to determine whether mid-pregnancy breastfeeding education, with a focus on either attitudes to breastfeeding or on technical aspects of breastfeeding, has an effect on rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration. Secondary aims of the study are to: explore what factors might affect the duration of breastfeeding and evaluate the interventions from the participant and childbirth facilitator perspectives.Methods/DesignA randomised controlled trial (RCT) design will be used. Women having their first baby, and planning to give birth as public patients at the Royal Women's Hospital (RWH), Melbourne, will be approached at 18‰ÛÒ20 weeks of pregnancy and invited to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly allocated to a control group or one of two group interventions: a previously designed and trialled tool to teach practical aspects of breastfeeding or an exploration of family attitudes to breastfeeding. The latter was developed and piloted by the investigators in conjunction with the group facilitators, prior to trial commencement. The interventions are planned to take place at 20‰ÛÒ25 weeks. Data will be collected by questionnaire at recruitment, at interview in hospital after the birth and by telephone interview six months later. Medical/obstetric outcomes will be obtained from the medical record. The sample size (972) was calculated to identify an increase in breastfeeding initiation from 75 to 85% and an increase from 40 to 50% in breastfeeding at six months."

1269,2003,Ab Initio Protein Structure Prediction Using Pathway Models,"Ab initio prediction is the challenging attempt to predict protein structures based only on sequence information and without using templates. It is often divided into two distinct sub-problems: (a) the scoring function that can distinguish native, or native-like structures, from non-native ones; and (b) the method of searching the conformational space. Currently, there is no reliable scoring function that can always drive a search to the native fold, and there is no general search method that can guarantee a significant sampling of near-natives. Pathway models combine the scoring function and the search. In this short review, we explore some of the ways pathway models are used in folding, in published works since 2001, and present a new pathway model, HMMSTR-CM, that uses a fragment library and a set of nucleation/propagation-based rules. The new method was used for ab initio predictions as part of CASP5. This work was presented at the Winter School in Bioinformatics, Bologna, Italy, 10‰ÛÒ14 February 2003."
1270,2003,"Ablation of NK Cell Function During Tumor Growth Favors Type 2-Associated Macrophages, Leading to Suppressed CTL Generation","Several reports describe regulatory interactions between NK cells and CTLs. We addressed the issue of NK participation in the early anti-tumor defense by inoculating ë±-ASGM-1 treated mice with BW-Sp3 T lymphoma. Rejection of BW-Sp3 depends on strong CTL responses. Our results demonstrated that (i) NK cells are a prerequisite for efficient CTL generation and (ii) the absence of NK cells favors the outgrowth of alternatively activated macrophages that can suppress CTL restimulation. In vitro studies demonstrate that in splenic cultures from NK-deficient, tumor-bearing mice, the presence of alternatively activated macrophages correlates with a lack of Type 1 cytokines, while the production of Type 2 cytokines is promoted. Provision of the Type 1 cytokine, IFN-ë_ can boost overall CTL activity but does not revert the dominance of arginase producing adherent cells in the NK-deficient CTL cultures. The role of NK effector functions in the efficient switch of the immune system towards Type 1 activation was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays. The results indicate that the accessory function of NK can depend at least partially on their ability to preferentially engage arginase-producing cells, suggesting that NK/macrophage lytic interactions might be involved in the switch from Type 2 to Type 1-dependent immune responses."
1271,2003,ABO exon and intron analysis in individuals with the AweakB phenotype reveals a novel O1v-A2 hybrid allele that causes four missense mutations in the A transferase,"BackgroundSince the cloning in 1990 of cDNA corresponding to mRNA transcribed at the blood-group ABO locus, polymorphisms due to ethnic and/or phenotypic variations have been reported. Some subgroups have been explained at the molecular level, but unresolved samples are frequently encountered in the reference laboratory.ResultsABO blood grouping discrepancies were investigated serologically and by ABO genotyping [duplex polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) ‰ÛÒ restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) and PCR ‰ÛÒ allele-specific-primer (ASP) across intron 6] and DNA sequencing of the ABO gene and its proposed regulatory elements. Blood samples from five individuals living in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden and the USA were analysed. These individuals were confirmed to be of Black ethnic origin and had the unusual AweakB phenotype but appeared to have the A2B genotype without previously reported mutations associated with weak A or B expression. Sequencing of this A allele (having 467C&gt;T and 1061delC associated with the common A2 [A201] allele) revealed three mutations regularly encountered in the O1v [O02] allele: 106C&gt;T (Val36Phe), 188G&gt;A (Arg63His), 220C&gt;T (Pro74Ser) in exons 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The additional presence of 46G&gt;A (Ala16Thr) was noted, whilst 189C&gt;T that normally accompanies 188G&gt;A in O1v was missing, as were all O1v-related mutations in exons 6 and 7 (261delG, 297A&gt;G, 646T&gt;A, 681G&gt;A, 771C&gt;T and 829G&gt;A). On screening other samples, 46G&gt;A was absent, but two new O alleles were found, a Jordanian O1 and an African O1v allele having 188G&gt;A but lacking 189C&gt;T. Sequencing of introns 2, 3, 4 and 5 in common alleles (A1 [A101], A2, B [B101], O1, O1vand O2 [O03]) revealed 7, 12, 17 and 8 polymorphic positions, respectively, suggesting that alleles could be defined by intronic sequences. These polymorphic sites allowed definition of a breakpoint in intron 5 where the O1v-related sequence was fused with A2 to form the new hybrid. Intron 6 has previously been sequenced. Four new mutations were detected in the hybrid allele and these were subsequently also found in intron 6 of A2 alleles in other Black African samples.ConclusionsA novel O1v-A2 hybrid was defined by ABO exon/intron analysis in five unrelated individuals of African descent with the AweakB blood group phenotype."
1272,2003,A brief guide to the selection of quality of life instrument,"There are numerous quality of life (QOL) scales. Because QOL experts are often partial to their own scales, researchers need to be able to select scales for themselves. Scales best suited for longitudinal purposes (clinical trials and audit) have different properties to those suited for cross-sectional studies (population and correlational studies and clinical use). The reason and logic of these differences is explained. For longitudinal use, researchers need to consider the relationship between item set, population and treatment; scales can be short, floor and ceiling effects must be avoided, and there should be extended response options. For cross-sectional use scales should have a wide range of items, should be longer, and there are no adverse floor and ceiling effects, and response options can be simpler to allow a larger set of items."
1273,2003,Abscess in Adenomyosis Mimicking a Malignancy in a 54-Year-Old Woman,"Background: Although there are a few reports describing abscess formation in endometriotic foci no report of abscess formation arising de novo within adenomyosis appears in the literature. Preoperative diagnosis of adenomyosis is frequently difficult because of non-specific signs and symptoms. Synchronous pelvic pathologies such as leiomyoma, endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia, as well as endometrial cancer may cause differential diagnostic problems. Case: A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman complaining of inguinal pain, nightsweats and hot flashes is presented. Radiologic examinations of the pelvis revealed a 95 ÌÑ 85 mm leiomyoma-like lesion including a 53 ÌÑ 43 mmcystic space and 9 ÌÑ 6 mmpapillary formation within the uterus raising clinical suspicion of malignancy. A total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed accompanied by a frozen section diagnosis. The frozen section revealed an abscess formation arising in a focus of adenomyosis. The postoperative period of the patient was uneventful. Conclusion : The present case, to our knowledge, is the first report representing abscess formation in adenomyosis. Abscess arising within adenomyosis can strongly raise the suspicion of endometrial cancer, particularly if the patient is postmenopausal. If endometrial cancer cannot be ruled out with definitive histopathological diagnosis in the preoperative period, a frozen section becomes mandatory during surgical intervention."
1274,2003,Absolute mRNA concentrations from sequence-specific calibration of oligonucleotide arrays,"Oligonucleotide microarrays are based on the hybridization of labeled mRNA molecules to short length oligonucleotide probes on a glass surface. Two effects have been shown to affect the raw data: the sequence dependence of the probe hybridization properties and the chemical saturation resulting from surface adsorption processes. We address both issues simultaneously using a physically motivated hybridization model. Based on publicly available calibration data sets, we show that Langmuir adsorption accurately describes GeneChip hybridization, with model parameters that we predict from the sequence composition of the probes. Because these parameters have physical units, we are able to estimate absolute mRNA concentrations in picomolar. Additionally, by accounting for chemical saturation, we substantially reduce the compressive bias of differential expression estimates that normally occurs toward high concentrations."

1277,2003,A Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition causes complete release of rat liver endonuclease G activity from its exclusive location within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Identification of a novel endo-exonuclease activity residing within the mitochondrial matrix,"Endonuclease G, a protein historically thought to be involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, repair, recombination and degradation, has recently been reported to be involved in nuclear DNA degradation during the apoptotic process. As a result, its involvement in mtDNA homeostasis has been called into question and has necessitated detailed analyses of its precise location within the mitochondrion. Data is presented localizing rat liver endonuclease G activity exclusively to the mitochondrial intermembrane space with no activity associated with either the interior face of the inner mitochondrial membrane or with the mitochondrial matrix. Additionally, it is shown that endonuclease G can be selectively released from the mitochondrion via induction of a Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition and that, upon its release, a further nuclease activity loosely associated with the interior face of the inner mitochondrial membrane and distinct in its properties from that of endonuclease G can be detected."
1278,2003,A Canadian national survey of attitudes and knowledge regarding preventive vaccines,"BackgroundVaccines have virtually eliminated many diseases, but public concerns about their safety could undermine future public health initiatives.ObjectiveTo determine Canadians' attitudes and knowledge about vaccines, particularly in view of increasing public concern about bioterrorism and the possible need for emergency immunizations after weaponized anthrax incidents and the events of September 11, 2001.MethodA 20-question survey based on well-researched dimensions of vaccine responsiveness was telephone-administered to a random sample of N = 1330 adult Canadians in January, 2002.Results1057 (79.5%) completed the survey. Respondents perceived vaccines to be highly effective and demonstrated considerable support for further vaccine research. However, results also indicate a lack of knowledge about vaccines and uncertainty regarding the safety.ConclusionsSupport for vaccines is broad but shallow. While Canadians hold generally positive attitudes about vaccines, support could be undermined by widely publicized adverse events. Better public education is required to maintain support for future public health initiatives."
1279,2003,A candidate metastasis-associated DNA marker for ductal mammary carcinoma,"BackgroundMolecular genetic markers to identify the 13% lymph node-negative mammary carcinomas that are prone to develop metastases would clearly be of considerable value in indicating those cases in need of early aggressive therapy.MethodsRepresentational difference analysis was used in an attempt to identify genetic alterations related to breast cancer metastasis by comparing genomic DNA from microdissected normal cells and from metastatic cells of ductal breast carcinoma patients.ResultsRepresentational difference analysis products yielded 10 unique metastasis-associated DNA sequences (MADS), i.e. products apparently lost in metastatic cell DNA. Of these sequences, MADS-IX was found to be lost in the transition from primary to metastasis in two out of five ductal breast carcinoma cases. This sequence was localized on chromosome 10q21 by radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The PTEN gene, which is also located on chromosome 10q, was detected to be present by PCR in all five cases. On the contrary, a breast carcinoma cell line, HCC-1937, which has homozygous loss of a region encompassing the PTEN gene, showed the presence of MADS-IX. PCR screening of three additional breast carcinoma cell lines with known losses in specific chromosomal regions also showed the presence of MADS-IX.ConclusionThese data suggest that MADS-IX possibly is part of a novel candidate metastasis-associated gene located close to the PTEN gene on chromosome 10q. The first set of PCR screening in five patient samples indicates that it could be used as a molecular marker for ductal mammary metastasis."
1280,2003,A candidate prostate cancer susceptibility gene encodes tRNA 3‰Û_ processing endoribonuclease,"tRNA 3‰Û_ processing endoribonuclease (3‰Û_ tRNase) is an enzyme responsible for the removal of a 3‰Û_ trailer from precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA). We purified ‰ö_85 kDa 3‰Û_ tRNase from pig liver and determined its partial sequences. BLAST search of them suggested that the enzyme was the product of a candidate human prostate cancer susceptibility gene, ELAC2, the biological function of which was totally unknown. We cloned a human ELAC2 cDNA and expressed the ELAC2 protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant ELAC2 was able to cleave human pre-tRNAArg efficiently. The 3‰Û_ tRNase activity of the yeast ortholog YKR079C was also observed. The C-terminal half of human ELAC2 was able to remove a 3‰Û_ trailer from pre-tRNAArg, while the N‰Ûterminal half failed to do so. In the human genome exists a gene, ELAC1, which seems to correspond to the C-terminal half of 3‰Û_ tRNase from ELAC2. We showed that human ELAC1 also has 3‰Û_-tRNase activity. Furthermore, we examined eight ELAC2 variants that seem to be associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer for 3‰Û_-tRNase activity. Seven ELAC2 variants which contain one to three amino acid substitutions showed efficient 3‰Û_-tRNase activities, while one truncated variant, which lacked a C-terminal half region, had no activity."
1281,2003,A Case of Liposarcoma With Peritonitis Due to Jejunal Perforation,"A 21-year-old man, who had been treated for congenital dilatation of the bile duct 13 years previously, presented with an acute abdomen. The physical examination suggested peritonitis, and an emergent laparotomy was performed. A perforation was foundin the jejunum approximately 100 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, followed by resection of a 60-cm jejunal segment. No tumorous lesions were found during the operation, and the resected jejunal segment showed only focal myxomatous thickening of the serosa. Despite intensive therapy, he died of uncontrollable septic shock 2 days after the operation. Unexpectedly, however, histological examination revealed a liposarcoma, showing an unclassifiable histology. From the distribution of the lesion and the histological findings, it is thought that a primary lesion was somewhere else, covered by severe adhesions due to the previous operation, and that the tumor cells spreading from it could have caused the jejunal perforation through vascular involvement. Although extremely rare, liposarcomas in the abdomen can cause intestinal perforation. It is important for both clinicians andpathologists to carefully investigate the cause of an unusual clinical presentation such as intestinal perforation."
1282,2003,A Case of Ovarian Actinomycosis,"Background: Pelvic actinomycosis is uncommon and often presents as a complication of an intrauterine device (IUD). A diagnosis of actinomycosis can be made from the finding of sulfur granules within inflammatory exudate on histologic examination after surgery. However, it may be possible to diagnose actinomycosis before surgery by finding Actinomyces-like organisms on Papanicolaou smears. Case: A 41-year-old woman had been diagnosed as having a pelvic abscess, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. She had been an IUD user for 6 years. Actinomyces-like organisms were detected in her previous Papanicolaou cervical smears. If the patient had been treated when the Actinomyces-like organisms were detected by Papanicolaou smears, the serious ovarian actinomycosis might have been avoided. Conclusion: We suggest that routine cervical examinations are important for women who are IUD users."
1283,2003,A case of sigmoid endometriosis difficult to differentiate from colon cancer,"BackgroundAlthough endometriosis with sigmoid serosal involvement is not uncommon in women of childbearing age, the mucosal involvement is rare and differential diagnosis from colon cancer may be difficult due to the lack of pathognomonic symptoms and the poor diagnostic yield of colonoscopy and colonic biopsies.Case presentationWe present a case of a young woman with sigmoid endometriosis, in which the initial diagnostic workup suggested colon cancer. Histologic evidence, obtained from a second colonoscopy, along with pelvic ultrasound findings led to the final diagnosis of intestinal endometriosis which was confirmed by laparoscopy.ConclusionColonic endometriosis is often a diagnostic challenge and should be considered in young women with symptoms from the lower gastrointestinal tract."
1284,2003,A cautionary note on the appropriateness of using a linkage resource for an association study,"BackgroundUtilizing a linkage resource for association analysis requires consideration both of the marker data used and correlations among relatives in pedigrees. We previously developed a method for association testing in pedigrees. We applied our method to 50 replicates of microsatellite data surrounding five genes involved in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the Genetic Analysis Workshop 13 (GAW13) simulated data and examined association with HDL as well as linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers.ResultsAlthough no association was intentionally simulated, we found significant evidence of weak LD between microsatellite markers (flanking/~5 cM from the genes), in some but not all replicates. This level of LD compared well to that observed in the real GAW13 Framingham data. Only one region had sufficient replicates to assess power, and this was low (12.5‰ÛÒ20.8%). More power was attained using all individuals and accounting for relationships, compared with one independent individual/pedigree, although this was not significant due to small sample sizes. Not accounting for relatedness inflated statistical significance (p &lt; 0.0001).ConclusionA correction for dependence is necessary in association studies to avoid an inflation of significance probabilities. Our results further illustrate that use of microsatellite marker data is not an effective approach for association testing."
1285,2003,Accumulation of large non-circular forms of the chromosome in recombination-defective mutants of Escherichia coli,"BackgroundDouble-strand breakage of chromosomal DNA is obviously a serious threat to cells because various activities of the chromosome depend on its integrity. However, recent experiments suggest that such breakage may occur frequently during ""normal"" growth in various organisms ‰ÛÒ from bacteria through vertebrates, possibly through arrest of a replication fork at some endogenous DNA damage.ResultsIn order to learn how the recombination processes contribute to generation and processing of the breakage, large (&gt; 2000 kb) linear forms of Escherichia coli chromosome were detected by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in various recombination-defective mutants. The mutants were analyzed in a rich medium, in which the wild-type strain showed fewer of these huge broken chromosomes than in a synthetic medium, and the following results were obtained: (i) Several recB and recC null mutants (in an otherwise rec+ background) accumulated these huge linear forms, but several non-null recBCD mutants (recD, recC1001, recC1002, recC1003, recC1004, recC2145, recB2154, and recB2155) did not. (ii) In a recBC sbcA background, in which RecE-mediated recombination is active, recA, recJ, recQ, recE, recT, recF, recO, and recR mutations led to their accumulation. The recJ mutant accumulated many linear forms, but this effect was suppressed by a recQ mutation. (iii) The recA, recJ, recQ, recF and recR mutations led to their accumulation in a recBC sbcBC background. The recJ mutation showed the largest amount of these forms. (iv) No accumulation was detected in mutants affecting resolution of Holliday intermediates, recG, ruvAB and ruvC, in any of these backgrounds.ConclusionThese results are discussed in terms of stepwise processing of chromosomal double-strand breaks."

1287,2003,A chemical enucleation method for the transfer of mitochondrial DNA to ìå¡ cells,"The study of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations has, in most cases, relied on the production of transmitochondrial cybrids. Although the procedure to produce such cybrids is well established, it is laborious and cumbersome. Moreover, the mechanical enucleation procedure is inefficient and different techniques have to be used depending on the adherence properties of the cell. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a chemical enucleation method that can have wide applicability for the production of transmitochondrial cybrids. The method is based on the use of actinomycin D to render the nuclear genome transcription/replication inactive and unable to recover after treatment. Such treated cells are fused to cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA and selected for the presence of a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. Our results showed that 95% of the clones recovered by this procedure are true transmitochondrial cybrids. This method greatly facilitates the production of transmitochondrial cybrids, thereby increasing the number of mtDNA mutations and the recipient cell types that can be studied by this system."
1288,2003,Acid‰ÛÒbase status of critically ill patients with acute renal failure: analysis based on Stewart‰ÛÒFigge methodology,"IntroductionThe aim of the present study is to understand the nature of acid‰ÛÒbase disorders in critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF) using the biophysical principles described by Stewart and Figge. A retrospective controlled study was carried out in the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital.Materials and methodsForty patients with ARF, 40 patients matched for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (matched control group), and 60 consecutive critically ill patients without ARF (intensive care unit control group) participated. The study involved the retrieval of biochemical data from computerized records, quantitative biophysical analysis using the Stewart‰ÛÒFigge methodology, and statistical comparison between the three groups. We measured serum sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, ionized calcium, albumin, lactate and arterial blood gases.ResultsIntensive care unit patients with ARF had a mild acidemia (mean pH 7.30 å± 0.13) secondary to metabolic acidosis with a mean base excess of -7.5 å± 7.2 mEq/l. However, one-half of these patients had a normal anion gap. Quantitative acid‰ÛÒbase assessment (Stewart‰ÛÒFigge methodology) revealed unique multiple metabolic acid‰ÛÒbase processes compared with controls, which contributed to the overall acidosis. The processes included the acidifying effect of high levels of unmeasured anions (13.4 å± 5.5 mEq/l) and hyperphosphatemia (2.08 å± 0.92 mEq/l), and the alkalinizing effect of hypoalbuminemia (22.6 å± 6.3 g/l).ConclusionsThe typical acid‰ÛÒbase picture of ARF of critical illness is metabolic acidosis. This acidosis is the result of the balance between the acidifying effect of increased unmeasured anions and hyperphosphatemia and the lesser alkalinizing effect of hypoalbuminemia."

1290,2003,A climate-based model predicts the spatial distribution of the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scapularis in the United States.,"An understanding of the spatial distribution of the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is a fundamental component in assessing human risk for Lyme disease in much of the United States. Although a county-level vector distribution map exists for the United States, its accuracy is limited by arbitrary categories of its reported presence. It is unknown whether reported positive areas can support established populations and whether negative areas are suitable for established populations. The steadily increasing range of I. scapularis in the United States suggests that all suitable habitats are not currently occupied. Therefore, we developed a spatially predictive logistic model for I. scapularis in the 48 conterminous states to improve the previous vector distribution map. We used ground-observed environmental data to predict the probability of established I. scapularis populations. The autologistic analysis showed that maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures as well as vapor pressure significantly contribute to population maintenance with an accuracy of 95% (p &lt; 0.0001). A cutoff probability for habitat suitability was assessed by sensitivity analysis and was used to reclassify the previous distribution map. The spatially modeled relationship between I. scapularis presence and large-scale environmental data provides a robust suitability model that reveals essential environmental determinants of habitat suitability, predicts emerging areas of Lyme disease risk, and generates the future pattern of I. scapularis across the United States."
1291,2003,A common polymorphism in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of hypoxia inducible factor-1ë± (HIF-1ë±) does not impair Pro-564 hydroxylation,"BackgroundThe hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription complex, which is activated by low oxygen tension, controls a diverse range of cellular processes including angiogenesis and erythropoiesis. Under normoxic conditions, the ë± subunit of HIF is rapidly degraded in a manner dependent on hydroxylation of two conserved proline residues at positions 402 and 564 in HIF-1ë± in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain. This allows subsequent recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which targets HIF for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylation of HIF is inhibited, allowing it to escape VHL-mediated degradation. The transcriptional regulation of the erythropoietin gene by HIF raises the possibility that HIF may play a role in disorders of erythropoiesis, such as idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE).ResultsPatients with IE were screened for changes in the HIF-1ë± coding sequence, and a change in the ODD domain that converts Pro-582 to Ser was identified in several patients. This same change, however, was also detected at a significant frequency, 0.073, in unaffected controls compared to 0.109 in the IE patient group. In vitro hydroxylation assays examining this amino acid change failed to reveal a discernible effect on HIF hydroxylation at Pro-564.ConclusionThe Pro582Ser change represents a common polymorphism of HIF-1ë± that does not impair HIF-1ë± prolyl hydroxylation. Although the Pro582Ser polymorphism is located in the ODD domain of HIF-1ë± it does not diminish the association of HIF-1ë± with VHL. Thus, it is unlikely that this polymorphism accounts for the erythrocytosis in the group of IE patients studied."

1293,2003,A comparative study of the inhibitory effects of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist following administration as a recombinant protein or by gene transfer,"Anakinra, the recombinant form of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as the drug Kineret‰ã¢, but it must be administered daily by subcutaneous injection. Gene transfer may offer a more effective means of delivery. In this study, using prostaglandin E2 production as a measure of stimulation, we quantitatively compared the ability of anakinra, as well as that of IL-1Ra delivered by gene transfer, to inhibit the biologic actions of IL-1ë_. Human synovial fibroblast cultures were incubated with a range of doses of anakinra or HIG-82 cells genetically modified to constitutively express IL-1Ra. The cultures were then challenged with recombinant human IL-1ë_ either simultaneously with addition of the source of IL-1Ra or 24 hours later. In a similar manner, the potencies of the two sources of IL-1Ra were compared when human synovial fibroblasts were challenged with IL-1ë_ produced constitutively by genetically modified cells. No significant difference in inhibitory activity was observed between recombinant protein and IL-1Ra provided by the genetically modified cells, under static culture conditions, even following incubation for 4 days. However, under culture conditions that provided progressive dilution of the culture media, striking differences between these methods of protein delivery became readily apparent. Constitutive synthesis of IL-1Ra by the genetically modified cells provided sustained or increased protection from IL-1 stimulation over time, whereas the recombinant protein became progressively less effective. This was particularly evident under conditions of continuous IL-1ë_ synthesis."
1294,2003,A comparison between the effort-reward imbalance and demand control models,"BackgroundTo compare the predictive validity of the demand/control and reward/imbalance models, alone and in combination with each other, for self-reported health status and the self-reported presence of any chronic disease condition.MethodsSelf-reports for psychosocial work conditions were obtained in a sample of sawmill workers using the demand/control and effort/reward imbalance models. The relative predictive validity of task-level control was compared with effort/reward imbalance. As well, the predictive validity of a model developed by combining task-level control with effort/reward imbalance was determined. Logistic regression was utilized for all models.ResultsThe demand/control and effort/reward imbalance models independently predicted poor self-reported health status. The effort-reward imbalance model predicted the presence of a chronic disease while the demand/control model did not. A model combining effort-reward imbalance and task-level control was a better predictor of self-reported health status and any chronic condition than either model alone. Effort reward imbalance modeled with intrinsic effort had marginally better predictive validity than when modeled with extrinsic effort only.ConclusionsFuture work should explore the combined effects of these two models of psychosocial stress at work on health more thoroughly."
1295,2003,"A comparison of Child-Pugh, APACHE II and APACHE III scoring systems in predicting hospital mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis","BackgroundThe aim of this study was to assess the prognostic accuracy of Child-Pugh and APACHE II and III scoring systems in predicting short-term, hospital mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis.Methods200 admissions of 147 cirrhotic patients (44% viral-associated liver cirrhosis, 33% alcoholic, 18.5% cryptogenic, 4.5% both viral and alcoholic) were studied prospectively. Clinical and laboratory data conforming to the Child-Pugh, APACHE II and III scores were recorded on day 1 for all patients. Discrimination was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under a ROC curve (AUC). Calibration was estimated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.ResultsOverall mortality was 11.5%. The mean Child-Pugh, APACHE II and III scores for survivors were found to be significantly lower than those of nonsurvivors. Discrimination was excellent for Child-Pugh (ROC AUC: 0.859) and APACHE III (ROC AUC: 0.816) scores, and acceptable for APACHE II score (ROC AUC: 0.759). Although the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic revealed adequate goodness-of-fit for Child-Pugh score (P = 0.192), this was not the case for APACHE II and III scores (P = 0.004 and 0.003 respectively)ConclusionOur results indicate that, of the three models, Child-Pugh score had the least statistically significant discrepancy between predicted and observed mortality across the strata of increasing predicting mortality. This supports the hypothesis that APACHE scores do not work accurately outside ICU settings."
1296,2003,"A comparison of Pfam and MEROPS: Two databases, one comprehensive, and one specialised.","BackgroundWe wished to compare two databases based on sequence similarity: one that aims to be comprehensive in its coverage of known sequences, and one that specialises in a relatively small subset of known sequences. One of the motivations behind this study was quality control. Pfam is a comprehensive collection of alignments and hidden Markov models representing families of proteins and domains. MEROPS is a catalogue and classification of enzymes with proteolytic activity (peptidases or proteases). These secondary databases are used by researchers worldwide, yet their contents are not peer reviewed. Therefore, we hoped that a systematic comparison of the contents of Pfam and MEROPS would highlight missing members and false-positives leading to improvements in quality of both databases. An additional reason for carrying out this study was to explore the extent of consensus in the definition of a protein family.ResultsAbout half (89 out of 174) of the peptidase families in MEROPS overlapped single Pfam families. A further 32 MEROPS families overlapped multiple Pfam families. Where possible, new Pfam families were built to represent most of the MEROPS families that did not overlap Pfam. When comparing the numbers of sequences found in the overlap between a MEROPS family and its corresponding Pfam family, in most cases the overlap was substantial (52 pairs of MEROPS and Pfam families had an intersection size of greater than 75% of the union) but there were some differences in the sets of sequences included in the MEROPS families versus the overlapping Pfam families.ConclusionsA number of the discrepancies between MEROPS families and their corresponding Pfam families arose from differences in the aims and philosophies of the two databases. Examination of some of the discrepancies highlighted additional members of families, which have subsequently been added in both Pfam and MEROPS. This has led to improvements in the quality of both databases. Overall there was a great deal of consensus between the databases in definitions of a protein family."
1297,2003,A comparison of skinfolds and leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance for the assessment of body composition in children,BackgroundThis field-based investigation examined the congruence between skinfolds and bioelectrical impedance in assessing body composition in children.MethodsSubjects were 162 female and 160 male children 10‰ÛÒ15 years of age. Skinfold measures obtained at the triceps and medial calf and a leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance system were used to determine percent fat using child-specific equations. Pearson product moment correlations were performed on the percent fat values obtained using skinfolds and bioelectric impedance for the entire data set. Separate correlations were also conducted on gender and age/gender subsets. Dependent t tests were used to compare the two techniques.ResultsPercent fat did not differ between skinfolds and bioelectrical impedance for the total subject pool. Bioelectrical impedance overestimated percent fat in girls by 2.6% and underestimated percent fat in boys by 1.7% (p &lt; 0.01). Correlations between skinfolds and bioelectrical impedance ranged from r = 0.51 to r = 0.90.ConclusionsLeg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance may be a viable alternative field assessment technique that is comparable to skinfolds. The small differences in percent fat between the two techniques may have limited practical significance in school-based health-fitness settings.
1298,2003,A comparison of three fission yeast mitochondrial genomes,"The fission yeasts are members of the fungal order Schizosaccharomycetales, a candidate deep-diverging group within Ascomycota. Although a great deal of molecular information is available from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a model eukaryote, very little is available from other members of this group. In order to better characterize mitochondrial genome evolution in this fungal lineage, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of two additional fission yeasts, Schizosaccharomyces octosporus and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus var. japonicus, was sequenced. Whereas the mtDNA of S.pombe is only 19 431 bp, the mtDNA of S.octosporus is 44 227 bp, and that of S.japonicus var. japonicus is over 80 kb. The size variation of these mtDNAs is due largely to non-coding regions. The gene content in the latter two mtDNAs is almost identical to that of the completely sequenced S.pombe mtDNA, which encodes 25 tRNA species, the large and small mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (rnl and rns), the RNA component of mitochondrial RNaseP (rnpB), mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal protein 3 (rps3), cytochrome oxidase subunits 1, 2 and 3 (cox1, cox2 and cox3) and ATP-synthase subunits 6, 8 and 9 (atp6, atp8 and atp9). However, trnI2(cau) (C modified to lysidine) is absent in the S.octosporus mtDNA, as are corresponding ATA codons in its protein-coding genes, and rps3 and rnpB are not found in the mtDNA of S.japonicus var. japonicus. The mtDNA of S.octosporus contains five double hairpin elements, the first report of these elements in an ascomycete. This study provides further evidence in favor of the mobility of these elements, and supports their role in mitochondrial genome rearrangement. The results of our phylogenetic analysis support the monophyly of the Schizosaccharomycetales, but question their grouping within the Archiascomycota."
1299,2003,A complex pathway for 3‰Û_ processing of the yeast U3 snoRNA,"Mature U3 snoRNA in yeast is generated from the 3‰Û_-extended precursors by endonucleolytic cleavage followed by exonucleolytic trimming. These precursors terminate in poly(U) tracts and are normally stabilised by binding of the yeast La homologue, Lhp1p. We report that normal 3‰Û_ processing of U3 requires the nuclear Lsm proteins. On depletion of any of the five essential proteins, Lsm2‰ÛÒ5p or Lsm8p, the normal 3‰Û_-extended precursors to the U3 snoRNA were lost. Truncated fragments of both mature and pre-U3 accumulated in the Lsm-depleted strains, consistent with substantial RNA degradation. Pre-U3 species were co-precipitated with TAP-tagged Lsm3p, but the association with spliced pre-U3 was lost in strains lacking Lhp1p. The association of Lhp1p with pre-U3 was also reduced on depletion of Lsm3p or Lsm5p, indicating that binding of Lhp1p and the Lsm proteins is interdependent. In contrast, a tagged Sm-protein detectably co-precipitated spliced pre-U3 species only in strains lacking Lhp1p. We propose that the Lsm2‰ÛÒ8p complex functions as a chaperone in conjunction with Lhp1p to stabilise pre-U3 RNA species during 3‰Û_ processing. The Sm complex may function as a back-up to stabilise 3‰Û_ ends that are not protected by Lhp1p."
1300,2003,A compositional segmentation of the human mitochondrial genome is related to heterogeneities in the guanine mutation rate,"We applied a hidden Markov model segmentation method to the human mitochondrial genome to identify patterns in the sequence, to compare these patterns to the gene structure of mtDNA and to see whether these patterns reveal additional characteristics important for our understanding of genome evolution, structure and function. Our analysis identified three segmentation categories based upon the sequence transition probabilities. Category 2 segments corresponded to the tRNA and rRNA genes, with a greater strand-symmetry in these segments. Category 1 and 3 segments covered the protein- coding genes and almost all of the non-coding D-loop. Compared to category 1, the mtDNA segments assigned to category 3 had much lower guanine abundance. A comparison to two independent databases of mitochondrial mutations and polymorphisms showed that the high substitution rate of guanine in human mtDNA is largest in the category 3 segments. Analysis of synonymous mutations showed the same pattern. This suggests that this heterogeneity in the mutation rate is partly independent of respiratory chain function and is a direct property of the genome sequence itself. This has important implications for our understanding of mtDNA evolution and its use as a ‰Û÷molecular clock‰Ûª to determine the rate of population and species divergence."

1304,2004,"15-deoxy-delta 12, 14-Prostaglandin J2 prevents reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization induced by oxidative stress","BackgroundWith the use of cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cells, we have previously described a number of cellular responses to oxidative stress caused by H2O2. We also demonstrated that the cytotoxicity caused by H2O2 could be prevented by the prostaglandin derivative, 15-deoxy-delta 12, 14-Prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2).ResultsFurther characterization of the experimental system indicated that the half-life of H2O2 in cultures was ~1 hour. At a fixed H2O2 concentration, the cytotoxicity was dependent on the volume of H2O2 solution used in the culture, such that higher volume caused more cytotoxicity. Most cells were committed to die if the culture was treated for 2 hours with a cytotoxic concentration of H2O2. The prostaglandin derivative, 15d-PGJ2, could prevent oxidative damage caused by t-butyl hydroperoxide, in addition to H2O2. Further studies indicated that both H2O2 and tBH caused an increase in reactive oxygen species and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment of cells with 1 ë_M 15d-PGJ2 led to a modest decrease in reactive oxygen species generation, and a significant restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential.ConclusionThis agent may be used in the future as a pharmacological tool for preventing cellular damage caused by oxidative stress."
1305,2004,16S rRNA gene based analysis of Enterobacter sakazakii strains from different sources and development of a PCR assay for identification,"BackgroundE. sakazakii is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen, implicated in food borne diseases causing meningitis or enteritis especially in neonates and infants. Cultural standard identification procedures for E. sakazakii include the observation of yellow pigmentation of colonies and a positive glucosidase activity. Up to now, only one PCR system based on a single available 16S rRNA gene sequence has been published for E. sakazakii identification. However, in our hands a preliminary evaluation of this system to a number of target and non-target strains showed significant specificity problems of this system. In this study full-length 16S rRNA genes of thirteen E. sakazakii strains from food, environment and human origin as well as the type strain ATCC 51329 were sequenced. Based on this sequence data a new specific PCR system for E. sakazakii was developed and evaluated.ResultsBy phylogenetic analysis of the new full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence data obtained we could show the presence of a second phylogenetic distinct lineage within the E. sakazakii species. The newly developed 16S rRNA gene targeting PCR system allows identification of E. sakazakii strains from both lineages. The assay's ability to correctly identify different E. sakazakii isolates as well as to differentiate E. sakazakii from other closely related Enterobacteriaceae species and other microorganisms was shown on 75 target and non-target strains.ConclusionBy this study we are presenting a specific and reliable PCR identification system, which is able to correctly identify E. sakazakii isolates from both phylogenetic distinct lines within the E. sakazakii species. The impact of this second newly described phylogenetic line within the E. sakazakii species in view of clinical and food safety aspects need further investigation."
1306,2004,17beta-estradiol induced vitellogenesis is inhibited by cortisol at the post-transcriptional level in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus),"This study was performed to investigate stress effects on the synthesis of egg yolk precursor, vitellogenin (Vtg) in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). In particular the effect of cortisol (F) was determined since this stress hormone has been suggested to interfere with vitellogenesis and is upregulated during sexual maturation in teleosts. Arctic char Vtg was purified and polyclonal antibodies were produced in order to develop tools to study regulation of vitellogenesis. The Vtg antibodies were used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The corresponding Vtg cDNA was cloned from a hepatic cDNA library in order to obtain DNA probes to measure Vtg mRNA expression. Analysis of plasma from juvenile Arctic char, of both sexes, exposed to different steroids showed that production of Vtg was induced in a dose dependent fashion by 17ë_-estradiol (E2), estrone and estriol. Apart from estrogens a high dose of F also upregulated Vtg. In addition, F, progesterone (P) and tamoxifen were tested to determine these compounds ability to modulate E2 induced Vtg synthesis at both the mRNA and protein level. Tamoxifen was found to inhibit E2 induced Vtg mRNA and protein upregulation. P did not alter the Vtg induction while F reduced the Vtg protein levels without affecting the Vtg mRNA levels. Furthermore the inhibition of Vtg protein was found to be dose dependent. Thus, the inhibitory effect of F on Vtg appears to be mediated at the post-transcriptional level."
1307,2004,"188Re radiopharmaceuticals for radiosynovectomy: evaluation and comparison of tin colloid, hydroxyapatite and tin-ferric hydroxide macroaggregates","BackgroundRadiosynovectomy is a therapy used to relieve pain and inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases. In this study three 188Re particulate compounds were characterized according to their physico-chemical properties and their biological behavior in rabbits. The results were compared in order to establish which was the radiopharmaceutical that better fits the requirements of this kind of radiotherapy.MethodsThree radiopharmaceutical formulations, tin colloid, hydroxyapatite particles (HA) and ferric hydroxide macroaggregates coated with tin colloid (FHMA), were physically characterized (number, volume and surface of the particles). For this purpose laser diffraction methodology was used. To evaluate cavity leakage of activity the following studies in New Zealand rabbits were performed: scintigraphic images for 48 hr after intraarticular injection of each radiopharmaceutical, biodistribution at 48 hr and urine samples collection during the first 24 hr post-radiopharmaceutical administration.ResultsLabeling procedures for 188Re-HA and 188Re-Sn-FHMA were labour intensive while 188Re-Sn was easily prepared. Furthermore, 188Re-Sn colloid offered the greatest surface area in the 2‰ÛÒ10 microm range and was obtained with a radiochemical purity over 95%, while percentage of bound activity for 188Re-HA and 188Re-Sn-FHMA were 55% and 92% respectively. Stability was verified for the three radiopharmaceuticals for 24 hr. Scintigraphic studies and biodistribution in rabbits after intraarticular administration of the radiopharmaceuticals showed relevant activity only in the knee, this being over 90% of the residual activity in the whole body at 48 hr in every case. Renal elimination of 188Re-Sn colloid and 188Re-Sn-FHMA was detected by activity measurements in urine samples, during the first 12 hr post-radiopharmaceutical injection.The percentage of activity retained in the knee was 69.1% for 188Re-Sn colloid, 55.1% for 188Re-Sn-FHMA and 33.6% for 188Re-HA.ConclusionThe 188Re-Sn colloid was easy to prepare, minimum facilities were required, was stable for 24 hr and showed minimal leakage from the joint after intraarticular injection into the rabbit's knee. Furthermore, 188Re-Sn colloid has greater retention in the knee when it is compared with the other radiopharmaceuticals, so it could provide the best therapeutic effect/absorbed dose ratio for the patient."
1308,2004,"24-hour changes in circulating prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone in male rats subjected to social isolation","BackgroundThis work analyzes the effect of social isolation (a mild stressor) on the 24-h variation of pituitary-testicular function in young Wistar rats, assessed by measuring circulating levels of prolactin, FSH, LH and testosterone.MethodsAnimals were either individually caged or kept in groups (4‰ÛÒ5 animals per cage) under a 12:12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 0800 h) for 30 days starting on day 35 of life. Rats were killed at 4-h intervals during a 24-h cycle, beginning at 0900 h.ResultsIsolation brought about a decrease in prolactin, LH and testosterone secretion and an increase of FSH secretion. In isolated rats the 24-h secretory pattern of prolactin and testosterone became modified, i.e., the maximum in prolactin seen in control animals at the beginning of the activity span was no longer detected, whereas the maximum in circulating testosterone taking place at 1700 h in controls was phase-delayed to 2100 h in isolated rats.ConclusionSocial isolation affects the 24-h variation of pituitary-testicular function in young rats. Secretion of prolactin, LH and testosterone decreases, and secretion of FSH increases, in isolated rats. The maximum in prolactin seen in group-caged rats at the beginning of the activity span is not observed in isolated rats. The maximum in circulating testosterone taking place at the second part of the rest span in controls is phase-delayed to the light-dark transition in isolated rats."

1311,2004,2‰Û_-Deoxyribonolactone lesion produces G‰ ÕA transitions in Escherichia coli,"2‰Û_-Deoxyribonolactone (dL) is a C1‰Û_-oxidized abasic site damage generated by a radical attack on DNA. Numerous genotoxic agents have been shown to produce dL including UV and ë_-irradiation, ene-dye antibiotics etc. At present the biological consequences of dL present in DNA have been poorly documented, mainly due to the lack of method for introducing the lesion in oligonucleotides. We have recently designed a synthesis of dL which allowed investigation of the mutagenicity of dL in Escherichia coli by using a genetic reversion assay. The lesion was site-specifically incorporated in a double-stranded bacteriophage vector M13G*1, which detects single-base-pair substitutions at position 141 of the lacZë± gene by a change in plaque color. In E.coli JM105 the dL-induced reversion frequency was 4.7 ÌÑ 10‰ÛÒ5, similar to that of the classic abasic site 2‰Û_-deoxyribose (dR). Here we report that a dL residue in a duplex DNA codes mainly for thymidine. The processing of dL in vivo was investigated by measuring lesion-induced mutation frequencies in DNA repair deficient E.coli strains. We showed a 32-fold increase in dL-induced reversion rate in AP endonuclease deficient (xth nfo) mutant compared with wild-type strain, indicating that the Xth and Nfo AP endonucleases participate in dL repair in vivo."
1312,2004,"2‰Û_-O-[2-[(N,N-dimethylamino)oxy]ethyl]-modified oligonucleotides inhibit expression of mRNA in vitro and in vivo","Synthesis and antisense activity of oligonucleotides modified with 2‰Û_-O-[2-[(N,N-dimethylamino)oxy] ethyl] (2‰Û_-O-DMAOE) are described. The 2‰Û_-O-DMAOE-modified oligonucleotides showed superior metabolic stability in mice. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotide ‰Û÷gapmers‰Ûª, with 2‰Û_-O-DMAOE- modified nucleoside residues at the ends and 2‰Û_-deoxy nucleosides residues in the central region, showed dose-dependent inhibition of mRNA expression in cell culture for two targets. ‰Û÷Gapmer‰Ûª oligonucleotides have one or two 2‰Û_-O-modified regions and a 2‰Û_-deoxyoligonucleotide phosphorothioate region that allows RNase H digestion of target mRNA. To determine the in vivo potency and efficacy, BalbC mice were treated with 2‰Û_-O-DMAOE gapmers and a dose-dependent reduction in the targeted C-raf mRNA expression was observed. Oligonucleotides with 2‰Û_-O-DMAOE modifications throughout the sequences reduced the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein expression very efficiently in HUVEC cells with an IC50 of 1.8 nM. The inhibition of ICAM-1 protein expression by these uniformly modified 2‰Û_-O-DMAOE oligonucleotides may be due to selective interference with the formation of the translational initiation complex. These results demonstrate that 2‰Û_-O-DMAOE- modified oligonucleotides are useful for antisense-based therapeutics when either RNase H-dependent or RNase H-independent target reduction mechanisms are employed."
1313,2004,2‰Û_-O-methyl-modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides have reduced non-specific effects in vitro,"Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have biological activity in treating various forms of cancer. The antisense effects of two types of 20mer ODNs, phosphorothioate-modified ODNs (S-ODNs) and S-ODNs with 12 2‰Û_-O-methyl groups (Me-S-ODNs), targeted to sites 109 and 277 of bcl-2 mRNA, were compared. Both types were at least as effective as G3139 (Genta, Inc.) in reducing the level of Bcl-2 protein in T24 cells following a 4 h transfection at a dose of 0.1 åµM. Circular dichroism spectra showed that both types formed A-form duplexes with the complementary RNA, and the melting temperatures were in the order of Me-S-ODNåáRNA &gt; normal DNAåáRNA &gt; S-ODNåáRNA. In comparison with the S-ODN, the Me-S-ODN had reduced toxic growth inhibitory effects, was less prone to bind the DNA-binding domain A of human replication protein A, and was as resistant to serum nucleases. Neither type of oligomer induced apoptosis, according to a PARP-cleavage assay. Hybrids formed with Me-S-ODN sequences were less sensitive to RNase H degradation than those formed with S-ODN sequences. Despite this latter disadvantage, the addition of 2‰Û_-O-methyl groups to a phosphorothioate-modified ODN is advantageous because of increased stability of binding and reduced non-specific effects."
1314,2004,"3,3‰Û_,4,4‰Û_,5-Pentachlorobiphenyl Inhibits Drug Efflux Through P-Glycoprotein in KB-3 Cells Expressing Mutant Human P-Glycoprotein","The effects on the drug efflux of 3,3‰Û_,4,4‰Û_,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), the most toxic of all coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs), were examined in KB-3 cells expressing human wild-type and mutant P-glycoprotein in which the 61st amino acid was substituted for serine or phenylalanine (KB3-Phe61). In the cells expressing P-glycoproteins, accumulations of vinblastine and colchicine decreased form 85% to 92% and from 62% to 91%, respectively, and the drug tolerances for these chemicals were increased. In KB3-Phe61, the decreases in drug accumulation were inhibited by adding PCB-126 in a way similar to that with cyclosporine A: by adding 1‰Ûäë_M PCB-126, the accumulations of vinblastine and colchicine increased up to 3.3- and 2.3-fold, respectively. It is suggested that PCB-126 decreased the drug efflux by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein in KB3-Phe61. Since there were various P-glycoproteins and many congeners of Co-PCBs, this inhibition has to be considered a new cause of the toxic effects of Co-PCBs."
1315,2004,3‰Û_-Box-dependent processing of human pre-U1 snRNA requires a combination of RNA and protein co-factors,"Using an in vitro system we have recently shown that the 3‰Û_ ends of human pre-snRNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase II are produced by RNA processing directed by the snRNA gene-specific 3‰Û_ box. Towards a complete characterization of this processing reaction we have further investigated the in vitro requirements for proper 3‰Û_ end formation of pre-U1 snRNA. Here we show that the 5‰Û_ cap plays a stimulatory role and processing requires creatine phosphate. Our results also indicate that the pre-U1 processing activity is heat sensitive and that an RNA component is required. In addition, the exact sequence adjacent to the 3‰Û_ box influences the position of the pre-U1 3‰Û_ end produced in vitro. Interestingly, the processing extract active for 3‰Û_-box-dependent processing also contains an activity that converts the 3‰Û_ end of RNA containing the U1 Sm protein binding site and the 3‰Û_ terminal stem‰ÛÒloop into the mature form."

1317,2004,3D-GENOMICS: a database to compare structural and functional annotations of proteins between sequenced genomes,"The 3D-GENOMICS database (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/3dgenomics/) provides structural annotations for proteins from sequenced genomes. In August 2003 the database included data for 93 proteomes. The annotations stored in the database include homologous sequences from various sequence databases, domains from SCOP and Pfam, patterns from Prosite and other predicted sequence features such as transmembrane regions and coiled coils. In addition to annotations at the sequence level, several precomputed cross- proteome comparative analyses are available based on SCOP domain superfamily composition. Annotations are available to the user via a web interface to the database. Multiple points of entry are available so that a user is able to: (i) directly access annotations for a single protein sequence via keywords or accession codes, (ii) examine a sequence of interest chosen from a summary of annotations for a particular proteome, or (iii) access precomputed frequency-based cross-proteome comparative analyses."
1318,2004,3 dimensional modelling of early human brain development using optical projection tomography,"BackgroundAs development proceeds the human embryo attains an ever more complex three dimensional (3D) structure. Analyzing the gene expression patterns that underlie these changes and interpreting their significance depends on identifying the anatomical structures to which they map and following these patterns in developing 3D structures over time. The difficulty of this task greatly increases as more gene expression patterns are added, particularly in organs with complex 3D structures such as the brain. Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) is a new technology which has been developed for rapidly generating digital 3D models of intact specimens. We have assessed the resolution of unstained neuronal structures within a Carnegie Stage (CS)17 OPT model and tested its use as a framework onto which anatomical structures can be defined and gene expression data mapped.ResultsResolution of the OPT models was assessed by comparison of digital sections with physical sections stained, either with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or by immunocytochemistry for GAP43 or PAX6, to identify specific anatomical features. Despite the 3D models being of unstained tissue, peripheral nervous system structures from the trigeminal ganglion (~300 ë_m by ~150 ë_m) to the rootlets of cranial nerve XII (~20 ë_m in diameter) were clearly identifiable, as were structures in the developing neural tube such as the zona limitans intrathalamica (core is ~30 ë_m thick). Fourteen anatomical domains have been identified and visualised within the CS17 model. Two 3D gene expression domains, known to be defined by Pax6 expression in the mouse, were clearly visible when PAX6 data from 2D sections were mapped to the CS17 model. The feasibility of applying the OPT technology to all stages from CS12 to CS23, which encompasses the major period of organogenesis for the human developing central nervous system, was successfully demonstrated.ConclusionIn the CS17 model considerable detail is visible within the developing nervous system at a minimum resolution of ~20 ë_m and 3D anatomical and gene expression domains can be defined and visualised successfully. The OPT models and accompanying technologies for manipulating them provide a powerful approach to visualising and analysing gene expression and morphology during early human brain development."
1319,2004,3-D structure of extracellular matrix regulates gene expression in cultured hepatic stellate cells to induce process elongation,"HSCs showed myofibroblast-like shapes when cultured on polystyrene surface or on type I collagen-coated surface, whereas HSCs cultured on type I collagen gel were induced to elongate cellular processes, suggesting that HSCs recognize 3-D structure of extracellular type I collagen fibrils and change their morphology and function. In this study we examined the differentially regulated gene expression by extracellular matrix (ECM) components by PCR-differential display (PCR-DD) analysis followed by cloning and FASTA homology search, and identified the mRNA species as a transcription factor SP1, breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), dystonin, and KAP3B. Regulation of dystonin and KAP3B expression was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Thus, cell surface-binding to extracellular interstitial collagen may trigger intracellular signaling and alteration in gene expression, and HSCs not only produce various ECM components but also change their morphology and gene expression in response to ECM components adhering to the cells."
1320,2004,4-D single particle tracking of synthetic and proteinaceous microspheres reveals preferential movement of nuclear particles along chromatin ‰ÛÒ poor tracks,"BackgroundThe dynamics of nuclear organization, nuclear bodies and RNPs in particular has been the focus of many studies. To understand their function, knowledge of their spatial nuclear position and temporal translocation is essential. Typically, such studies generate a wealth of data that require novel methods in image analysis and computational tools to quantitatively track particle movement on the background of moving cells and shape changing nuclei.ResultsWe developed a novel 4-D image processing platform (TIKAL) for the work with laser scanning and wide field microscopes. TIKAL provides a registration software for correcting global movements and local deformations of cells as well as 2-D and 3-D tracking software. With this new tool, we studied the dynamics of two different types of nuclear particles, namely nuclear bodies made from GFP-NLS-vimentin and microinjected 0.1 ë_m ‰ÛÒ wide polystyrene beads, by live cell time-lapse microscopy combined with single particle tracking and mobility analysis. We now provide a tool for the automatic 3-D analysis of particle movement in parallel with the acquisition of chromatin density data.ConclusionsKinetic analysis revealed 4 modes of movement: confined obstructed, normal diffusion and directed motion. Particle tracking on the background of stained chromatin revealed that particle movement is directly related to local reorganization of chromatin. Further a direct comparison of particle movement in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm exhibited an entirely different kinetic behaviour of vimentin particles in both compartments.The kinetics of nuclear particles were slightly affected by depletion of ATP and significantly disturbed by disruption of actin and microtubule networks. Moreover, the hydration state of the nucleus had a strong impact on the mobility of nuclear bodies since both normal diffusion and directed motion were entirely abolished when cells were challenged with 0.6 M sorbitol. This effect correlated with the compaction of chromatin. We conclude that alteration in chromatin density directly influences the mobility of protein assemblies within the nucleus."
1321,2004,"4th meeting of the EU research network EUROME: From the identification of genes and cellular networks in murine models of arthritis to novel therapeutic intervention strategies in rheumatoid arthritis, London, UK, 9 March 2004","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common human disease with a prevalence of about 1% in most parts of the world. At the time of symptom onset it is difficult to predict the severity of subsequent disease course. After 2 years joint erosions are seen in most patients, and most patients become clinically disabled within 20 years. A recent meeting at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology (Imperial College, London) brought together representatives from several European centres of excellence, to discuss research funded by the EU Framework 5 Quality of Life Programme. This research network combines gene and protein expression profiling with different animal models of RA to identify cells, genes and pathways contributing to arthritis initiation, progression and chronicity. The studies discussed highlight the reality that collaboration between different research groups is the basis of groundbreaking research and, it is hoped, eventual new therapies for RA."

1323,2004,5‰Û_-Untranslated regions with multiple upstream AUG codons can support low-level translation via leaky scanning and reinitiation,"Upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are common features of mRNAs that encode regulatory proteins and have been shown to profoundly influence translation of the main ORF. In this study, we employed a series of artificial 5‰Û_-untranslated regions (5‰Û_-UTRs) containing one or more uAUGs/uORFs to systematically assess translation initiation at the main AUG by leaky scanning and reinitiation mechanisms. Constructs containing either one or two uAUGs in varying contexts but without an in-frame stop codon upstream of the main AUG were used to analyse the leaky scanning mechanism. This analysis largely confirmed the ranking of different AUG contextual sequences that was determined previously by Kozak. In addition, this ranking was the same for both the first and second uAUGs, although the magnitude of initiation efficiency differed. Moreover, ‰ö_10% of ribosomes exhibited leaky scanning at uAUGs in the most favourable context and initiated at a downstream AUG. A second group of constructs containing different numbers of uORFs, each with optimal uAUGs, were used to measure the capacity for reinitiation. We found significant levels of initiation at the main ORF even in constructs containing four uORFs, with nearly 10% of ribosomes capable of reinitiating five times. This study shows that for mRNAs containing multiple uORFs/uAUGs, ribosome reinitiation and leaky scanning are efficient mechanisms for initiation at their main AUGs."

1325,2004,"5-Lipoxygenase Pathway, Dendritic Cells, and Adaptive Immunity","5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway is the major source of potent proinflammatory leukotrienes (LTs) issued from the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), and best known for their roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. These lipid mediators are mainly released from myeloid cells and may act as physiological autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules, and play a central role in regulating the interaction between innate and adaptive immunity. The biological actions of LTs including their immunoregulatory and proinflammatory effects are mediated through extracellular specific G-protein-coupled receptors. Despite their role in inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, LTs may have important effects on dendritic cells (DC)-mediated adaptive immunity. Several lines of evidence show that DC not only are important source of LTs, but also become targets of their actions by producing other lipid mediators and proinflammatory molecules. This review focuses on advances in 5-LO pathway biology, the production of LTs from DC and their role on various cells of immune system and in adaptive immunity."
1326,2004,7-Ketocholesterol modulates intercellular communication through gap-junction in bovine lens epithelial cells,"BackgroundConnexin43 (Cx43) is an integral membrane protein that forms intercellular channels called gap junctions. Intercellular communication in the eye lens relies on an extensive network of gap junctions essential for the maintenance of lens transparency. The association of Cx43 with cholesterol enriched lipid raft domains was recently demonstrated. The objective of this study is to assess if products of cholesterol oxidation (oxysterols) affect gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC).ResultsPrimary cultures of lens epithelial cells (LEC) were incubated with 7-ketocholesterol (7-Keto), 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) or cholesterol and the subcellular distribution of Cx43 was evaluated by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The levels of Cx43 present in gap junction plaques were assessed by its insolubility in Triton X-100 and quantified by western blotting. The stability of Cx43 at the plasma membrane following incubation with oxysterols was evaluated by biotinylation of cell surface proteins. Gap junction intercellular communication was evaluated by transfer of the dye Lucifer yellow. The results obtained showed that 7-keto induces an accumulation of Cx43 at the plasma membrane and an increase in intercellular communication through gap junction. However, incubation with cholesterol or 25-OH did not lead to significant alterations on subcellular distribution of Cx43 nor in intercellular communication. Data further suggests that increased intercellular communication results from increased stability of Cx43 at the plasma membrane, presumably forming functional gap-junctions, as suggested by decreased solubility of Cx43 in 1% Triton X-100. The increased stability of Cx43 at the plasma membrane seems to be specific and not related to disruption of endocytic pathway, as demonstrated by dextran uptake.ConclusionsResults demonstrate, for the first time, that 7-keto induces an increase in gap junction intercellular communication, that is most likely due to an increased stability of protein at the plasma membrane and to increased abundance of Cx43 assembled in gap junction plaques."
1327,2004,+874(T‰ ÕA) single nucleotide gene polymorphism does not represent a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease,"In the recent years, several cytokines have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) development and progression and many studies have correlated this risk with polymorphisms in the genes encoding these molecules. Also the type 1 cytokine interferon (IFN)-ë_ belongs to a cytokine class that affects the immune function; in fact it plays a major role in defence against viruses and intracellular pathogens but also in the induction of the immune-mediated inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of IFN-ë_ in AD by studying the association of +874T‰ ÕA IFN-ë_ gene polymorphism with AD. We included in this study 115 AD patients (70 women, 45 men, mean age 80) and 90 sex and age-matched healthy controls (HC, 51 women, 39 men, mean age 82) from northern Italy. Genomic DNA was extracted with the salting-out method from whole blood of all subjects; the genotyping at IFN-ë_ loci was assessed with ARMS-PCR. The data obtained from the +874T‰ ÕA IFN-ë_ gene polymorphism analysis of AD patients and HC lack of any statistically significant differences also when stratified according to gender. In conclusion these results confirm the previous shown lack of association between +874T‰ ÕA IFN-ë_ gene polymorphism and the risk of AD. However, other polymorphisms have been demonstrated to influence IFN-ë_ transcription and since natural killer cells of AD patients show higher production of the cytokine, further analysis will be necessary to clarify the role of this gene in the pathogenesis of the disease."
1328,2004,"8-Cl-Adenosine enhances 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced growth inhibition without affecting 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-stimulated differentiation of primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes","BackgroundEpidermal keratinocytes continuously proliferate and differentiate to form the mechanical and water permeability barrier that makes terrestrial life possible. In certain skin diseases, these processes become dysregulated, resulting in abnormal barrier formation. In particular, skin diseases such as psoriasis, actinic keratosis and basal and squamous cell carcinomas are characterized by hyperproliferation and aberrant or absent differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. We previously demonstrated that 8-Cl-adenosine (8-Cl-Ado) can induce keratinocyte growth arrest without inducing differentiation. ResultsTo determine if this agent might be useful in treating hyperproliferative skin disorders, we investigated whether 8-Cl-Ado could enhance the ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], a known keratinocyte differentiating agent and a clinical treatment for psoriasis, to inhibit keratinocyte growth. We found that low concentrations of 8-Cl-Ado and 1,25(OH)2D3 appeared to act additively to reduce proliferation of primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes. However, another agent (transforming growth factor-beta) that triggers growth arrest without inducing differentiation also coincidentally inhibits differentiation elicited by other agents; inhibition of differentiation is suboptimal for treating skin disorders, as differentiation is often already reduced. Thus, we determined whether 8-Cl-Ado also decreased keratinocyte differentiation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3, as measured using the early and late differentiation markers, keratin 1 protein levels and transglutaminase activity, respectively. 8-Cl-Ado did not affect 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated keratin 1 protein expression or transglutaminase activity. ConclusionsOur results suggest that 8-Cl-Ado might be useful in combination with differentiating agents for the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders of the skin."

1331,2004,A 16S rRNA‰ÛÒtRNA product containing a nucleotide phototrimer and specific for tRNA in the P/E hybrid state in the Escherichia coli ribosome,"Ribosome complexes containing deacyl-tRNA1Val or biotinylvalyl-tRNA1Val and an mRNA analog have been irradiated with wavelengths specific for activation of the cmo5U nucleoside at position 34 in the tRNA1Val anticodon loop. The major product for both types of tRNA is the cross-link between 16S rRNA (C1400) and the tRNA (cmo5U34) characterized already by Ofengand and his collaborators [Prince et al. (1982) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 79, 5450‰ÛÒ5454]. However, in complexes containing deacyl-tRNA1Val, an additional product is separated by denaturing PAGE and this is shown to involve C1400 and m5C967 of 16S rRNA and cmo5U34 of the tRNA. Puromycin treatment of the biotinylvalyl-tRNA1Val ‰ÛÒ70S complex followed by irradiation, results in the appearance of the unusual photoproduct, which indicates an immediate change in the tRNA interaction with the ribosome after peptide transfer. These results indicate an altered interaction between the tRNA anticodon and the 30S subunit for the tRNA in the P/E hybrid state compared with its interaction in the classic P/P state."
1332,2004,A 21-amino acid peptide from the cysteine cluster II of the family D DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus horikoshii stimulates its nuclease activity which is Mre11-like and prefers manganese ion as the cofactor,"Family D DNA polymerase (PolD) is a new type of DNA polymerase possessing polymerization and 3‰Û_‰ÛÒ5‰Û_ exonuclease activities. Here we report the characterization of the nuclease activity of PolD from Pyrococcus horikoshii. By site-directed mutagenesis, we verified that the putative Mre11-like nuclease domain in the small subunit (DP1), predicted according to computer analysis and structure inference reported previously, is the catalytic domain. We show that D363, H365 and H454åÊare the essential residues, while D407, N453, H500, H563 and H565åÊare critical residues for the activity. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating that manganese, rather than magnesium, is the preferable metal ion for the nuclease activity of PolD. We also show that DP1 alone is insufficient to perform full catalysis, which additionally requires the formation of the PolD complex and manganese ion. We found that a 21 amino acid, subunit-interacting peptide of the sequence from cysteine cluster II of the large subunit (DP2) stimulates the exonuclease activity of DP1 and the internal deletion mutants of PolD lacking the 21-aa sequence. This indicates that the putative zinc finger motif of the cysteine cluster II is deeply involved in the nucleolytic catalysis."

These studies focused on subjects (largely children) with various severities of intellectual impairment with or without additional physical clinical features such as dysmorphisms. However it is well established that prevalence of schizophrenia is around three times greater in those with mild mental retardation. The rates of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder have also been reported as increased in people with mental retardation. We describe here a screen for telomeric abnormalities in a cohort of 69 patients in which mental retardation co-exists with severe psychiatric illness.MethodsWe have applied two techniques, subtelomeric fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation (MAPH) to detect abnormalities in the patient group.ResultsA subtelomeric deletion was discovered involving loss of 4q in a patient with co-morbid schizoaffective disorder and mental retardation.ConclusionThe precise region of loss has been defined allowing us to identify genes that may contribute to the clinical phenotype through hemizygosity. Interestingly, the region of 4q loss exactly matches that linked to bipolar affective disorder in a large multiply affected Australian kindred."

Common problems such as determining the probability that observed associations are false negative or false positive, the potential effects of admixture, and determining which polymorphisms to examine in which genes and in which populations were examined. Problems specific to haplotype analysis were discussed, with emphasis on haplotype block structures and on how to use haplotypes in analysis. Questions were also posed as to determining the functional relevance of single nucleotide polymorphisms in molecular epidemiology.

Using the Chime web browser plug-in, users can view 3D representations of the superimpositions and clusters. The unique collection and representation of data on amino acid‰ÛÒnucleotide interactions facilitates understanding the specificity of protein‰ÛÒnucleic acid interactions at a more fundamental level, and allows comparison of otherwise extremely disparate sets of structures.

1339,2004,A Bayesian Hierarchical Approach for Relating PM2.5 Exposure to Cardiovascular Mortality in North Carolina,"Considerable attention has been given to the relationship between levels of fine particulate matter (particulate matter ‰ä_ 2.5 ë_m in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5) in the atmosphere and health effects in human populations. Since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began widespread monitoring of PM2.5 levels in 1999, the epidemiologic community has performed numerous observational studies modeling mortality and morbidity responses to PM2.5 levels using Poisson generalized additive models (GAMs). Although these models are useful for relating ambient PM2.5 levels to mortality, they cannot directly measure the strength of the effect of exposure to PM2.5 on mortality. In order to assess this effect, we propose a three-stage Bayesian hierarchical model as an alternative to the classical Poisson GAM. Fitting our model to data collected in seven North Carolina counties from 1999 through 2001, we found that an increase in PM2.5 exposure is linked to increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in the same day and next 2 days. Specifically, a 10-ë_g/m3 increase in average PM2.5 exposure is associated with a 2.5% increase in the relative risk of current-day cardiovascular mortality, a 4.0% increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality the next day, and an 11.4% increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality 2 days later. Because of the small sample size of our study, only the third effect was found to have &gt; 95% posterior probability of being &gt; 0. In addition, we compared the results obtained from our model to those obtained by applying frequentist (or classical, repeated sampling-based) and Bayesian versions of the classical Poisson GAM to our study population."
1340,2004,A Bayesian method for identifying missing enzymes in predicted metabolic pathway databases,"BackgroundThe PathoLogic program constructs Pathway/Genome databases by using a genome's annotation to predict the set of metabolic pathways present in an organism. PathoLogic determines the set of reactions composing those pathways from the enzymes annotated in the organism's genome. Most annotation efforts fail to assign function to 40‰ÛÒ60% of sequences. In addition, large numbers of sequences may have non-specific annotations (e.g., thiolase family protein). Pathway holes occur when a genome appears to lack the enzymes needed to catalyze reactions in a pathway. If a protein has not been assigned a specific function during the annotation process, any reaction catalyzed by that protein will appear as a missing enzyme or pathway hole in a Pathway/Genome database.ResultsWe have developed a method that efficiently combines homology and pathway-based evidence to identify candidates for filling pathway holes in Pathway/Genome databases. Our program not only identifies potential candidate sequences for pathway holes, but combines data from multiple, heterogeneous sources to assess the likelihood that a candidate has the required function. Our algorithm emulates the manual sequence annotation process, considering not only evidence from homology searches, but also considering evidence from genomic context (i.e., is the gene part of an operon?) and functional context (e.g., are there functionally-related genes nearby in the genome?) to determine the posterior belief that a candidate has the required function. The method can be applied across an entire metabolic pathway network and is generally applicable to any pathway database. The program uses a set of sequences encoding the required activity in other genomes to identify candidate proteins in the genome of interest, and then evaluates each candidate by using a simple Bayes classifier to determine the probability that the candidate has the desired function. We achieved 71% precision at a probability threshold of 0.9 during cross-validation using known reactions in computationally-predicted pathway databases. After applying our method to 513 pathway holes in 333 pathways from three Pathway/Genome databases, we increased the number of complete pathways by 42%. We made putative assignments to 46% of the holes, including annotation of 17 sequences of previously unknown function.ConclusionsOur pathway hole filler can be used not only to increase the utility of Pathway/Genome databases to both experimental and computational researchers, but also to improve predictions of protein function."
1341,2004,ABC: software for interactive browsing of genomic multiple sequence alignment data,"BackgroundAlignment and comparison of related genome sequences is a powerful method to identify regions likely to contain functional elements. Such analyses are data intensive, requiring the inclusion of genomic multiple sequence alignments, sequence annotations, and scores describing regional attributes of columns in the alignment. Visualization and browsing of results can be difficult, and there are currently limited software options for performing this task.ResultsThe Application for Browsing Constraints (ABC) is interactive Java software for intuitive and efficient exploration of multiple sequence alignments and data typically associated with alignments. It is used to move quickly from a summary view of the entire alignment via arbitrary levels of resolution to individual alignment columns. It allows for the simultaneous display of quantitative data, (e.g., sequence similarity or evolutionary rates) and annotation data (e.g. the locations of genes, repeats, and constrained elements). It can be used to facilitate basic comparative sequence tasks, such as export of data in plain-text formats, visualization of phylogenetic trees, and generation of alignment summary graphics.ConclusionsThe ABC is a lightweight, stand-alone, and flexible graphical user interface for browsing genomic multiple sequence alignments of specific loci, up to hundreds of kilobases or a few megabases in length. It is coded in Java for cross-platform use and the program and source code are freely available under the General Public License. Documentation and a sample data set are also available ."
1342,2004,Aberrant CBFA2T3B gene promoter methylation in breast tumors,"BackgroundThe CBFA2T3 locus located on the human chromosome region 16q24.3 is frequently deleted in breast tumors. CBFA2T3 gene expression levels are aberrant in breast tumor cell lines and the CBFA2T3B isoform is a potential tumor suppressor gene. In the absence of identified mutations to further support a role for this gene in tumorigenesis, we explored whether the CBFA2T3B promoter region is aberrantly methylated and whether this correlates with expression.ResultsAberrant hypo and hypermethylation of the CBFA2T3B promoter was detected in breast tumor cell lines and primary breast tumor samples relative to methylation index interquartile ranges in normal breast counterpart and normal whole blood samples. A statistically significant inverse correlation between aberrant CBFA2T3B promoter methylation and gene expression was established.ConclusionCBFA2T3B is a potential breast tumor suppressor gene affected by aberrant promoter methylation and gene expression. The methylation levels were quantitated using a second-round real-time methylation-specific PCR assay. The detection of both hypo and hypermethylation is a technicality regarding the methylation methodology."
1343,2004,Ability to perform activities of daily living is the main factor affecting quality of life in patients with dementia,"BackgroundDementia is a chronic illness associated with a progressive loss of cognitive and intellectual abilities, such as memory, judgment and abstract thinking.The objective of this study was to assess the health utilities of patients with dementia in Europe and identify the key factors influencing their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQol).MethodsThis study used cross-sectional data from the Odense study; a Danish cohort of patients aged 65‰ÛÒ84 living in Odense, Denmark. A total of 244 patients with mild to severe dementia were interviewed together with a caregiver about their health status and activities of daily living (ADL). Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable dementia. Vascular dementia and other types of dementia were diagnosed according to the DSM-IIIR criteria. Severity of dementia was defined by score intervals on the Mini Mental State Examination score: mild (MMSE 20‰ÛÒ30), moderate (MMSE 10‰ÛÒ19), and severe (MMSE 0‰ÛÒ9). Based on the ADL information, the patients' dependency level was defined as either dependent or independent. Questions from the Odense Study were mapped into each of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D in order to assess patients' HRQol. Danish EQ-5D social tariffs were used to value patients' HRQol.A regression analysis of EQ-5D values was conducted with backward selection on gender, age, severity, ADL level and setting in order to determine the main factor influencing HRQoL.ResultsThe EQ-5D weight in patients independent upon others in ADL was 0.641 (95% CI: [0.612‰ÛÒ0.669]), and in those dependent upon others was 0.343 (95% CI: [0.251‰ÛÒ0.436]).ConclusionDependency upon others to perform ADL was the main factor affecting HRQoL."
1344,2004,A biocompatible magnetic film: synthesis and characterization,"BackgroundBiotechnology applications of magnetic gels include biosensors, targeted drug delivery, artificial muscles and magnetic buckles. These gels are produced by incorporating magnetic materials in the polymer composites.MethodsA biocompatible magnetic gel film has been synthesized using polyvinyl alcohol. The magnetic gel was dried to generate a biocompatible magnetic film. Nanosized iron oxide particles (ë_-Fe2O3, ~7 nm) have been used to produce the magnetic gel.ResultsThe surface morphology and magnetic properties of the gel films were studied. The iron oxide particles are superparamagnetic and the gel film also showed superparamagnetic behavior.ConclusionMagnetic gel made out of crosslinked magnetic nanoparticles in the polymer network was found to be stable and possess the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles."
1345,2004,"A bipolar DNA helicase gene, herA, clusters with rad50, mre11 and nurA genes in thermophilic archaea","We showed previously that rad50 and mre11 genes of thermophilic archaea are organized in an operon-like structure with a third gene (nurA) encoding a 5‰Û_ to 3‰Û_ exonuclease. Here, we show that the rad50, mre11 and nurA genes from the hyperthermo philic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are co-transcribed with a fourth gene encoding a DNA helicase. This enzyme (HerA) is the prototype of a new class of DNA helicases able to utilize either 3‰Û_ or 5‰Û_ single-stranded DNA extensions for loading and subsequent DNA duplex unwinding. To our knowledge, DNA helicases capable of translocating along the DNA in both directions have not been identified previously. Sequence analysis of HerA shows that it is a member of the TrwB, FtsK and VirB4/VirD4 families of the PilT class NTPases. HerA homologs are found in all thermophilic archaeal species and, in all cases except one, the rad50, mre11, nurA and herA genes are grouped together. These results suggest that the archaeal Rad50‰ÛÒMre11 complex might act in association with a 5‰Û_ to 3‰Û_ exonuclease (NurA) and a bipolar DNA helicase (HerA) indicating a probable involvement in the initiation step of homologous recombination."
1346,2004,Ablation lesions in Koch's triangle assessed by three-dimensional myocardial contrast echocardiography,"BackgroundMyocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) allows visualization of radiofrequency (RF) ablation lesions in the left ventricle in an animal model. Aim: To test whether MCE allows visualization of RF and cryo ablation lesions in the human right atrium using three-dimensional echocardiography.Methods18 patients underwent catheter ablation of a supraventricular tachycardia and were included in this prospective single-blind study. Twelve patients were ablated inside Koch's triangle and 6, who served as controls, outside this area. Three-dimensional echocardiography of Koch's triangle was performed before and after the ablation procedure in all patients, using respiration and ECG gated pullback of a 9 MHz ICE transducer, with and without continuous intravenous echocontrast infusion (SonoVue, Bracco). Two independent observers analyzed the data off-line.ResultsMCE identified ablation lesions as a low contrast area within the normal atrial myocardial tissue. Craters on the endocardial surface were seen in 10 (83%) patients after ablation. Lesions were identified in 11 out of 12 patients (92%). None of the control patients were recognized as having been ablated. The confidence score of the independent echo reviewer tended to be higher when the number of applications increased.Conclusions1. MCE allows direct visualization of ablation lesions in the human atrial myocardium. 2. Both RF and cryo energy lesions can be identified using MCE."
1347,2004,Abnormal auditory mismatch response in tinnitus sufferers with high-frequency hearing loss is associated with subjective distress level,"BackgroundTinnitus is an auditory sensation frequently following hearing loss. After cochlear injury, deafferented neurons become sensitive to neighbouring intact edge-frequencies, guiding an enhanced central representation of these frequencies. As psychoacoustical data [1-3] indicate enhanced frequency discrimination ability for edge-frequencies that may be related to a reorganization within the auditory cortex, the aim of the present study was twofold: 1) to search for abnormal auditory mismatch responses in tinnitus sufferers and 2) relate these to subjective indicators of tinnitus.ResultsUsing EEG-mismatch negativity, we demonstrate abnormalities (N = 15) in tinnitus sufferers that are specific to frequencies located at the audiometrically normal lesion-edge as compared to normal hearing controls (N = 15). Groups also differed with respect to the cortical locations of mismatch responsiveness. Sources in the 90‰ÛÒ135 ms latency window were generated in more anterior brain regions in the tinnitus group. Both measures of abnormality correlated with emotional-cognitive distress related to tinnitus (r ~ .76). While these two physiological variables were uncorrelated in the control group, they were correlated in the tinnitus group (r = .72). Concerning relationships with parameters of hearing loss (depth and slope), slope turned out to be an important variable. Generally, the steeper the hearing loss is the less distress related to tinnitus was reported. The associations between slope and the relevant neurophysiological variables are in agreement with this finding.ConclusionsThe present study is the first to show near-to-complete separation of tinnitus sufferers from a normal hearing control group based on neurophysiological variables. The finding of lesion-edge specific effects and associations with slope of hearing loss corroborates the assumption that hearing loss is the basis for tinnitus development. It is likely that some central reorganization follow a damage to hearing receptors, even though the paradoxical results indicate that they most likely are somewhat different than originally assumed (see Background). One partial explanation might lie in the involvement of top-down (presumably frontal-lobe) controlled processes. A better comprehension of the exact mechanisms leading to the present results could have a broad impact on the understanding and perhaps treatment of tinnitus."
1348,2004,"Abnormal bone composition in female juvenile American alligators from a pesticide-polluted lake (Lake Apopka, Florida).","Reproductive disorders have been found in pesticide-exposed alligators living in Lake Apopka, Florida (USA). These disorders have been hypothesized to be caused by exposure to endocrine- disruptive estrogen-like contaminants. The aim of this study was to expand our analysis beyond previous studies by investigating whether bone tissue, known to be affected by sex steroid hormones, is a potential target of endocrine disruptors. Long bones from 16 juvenile female alligators from Lake Apopka (pesticide-contaminated lake) and Lake Woodruff (control lake) were evaluated by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. We observed significant differences in bone composition, with female alligators from the contaminated lake having greater trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), total BMD, and trabecular mineral content compared with females from the control lake (p &lt; 0.05). Increased trabecular and total BMD measurements suggest that juvenile female alligators from Lake Apopka were exposed to contaminants that created an internal environment more estrogenic than that normally observed. This estrogenic environment could be caused by both natural and anthropogenic compounds. Effects on BMD indicate interference with bone homeostasis. We hypothesize that contaminants present in the lake inhibit the natural and continuous resorption of bone tissue, resulting in increased bone mass. Although this is the only study performed to date examining effects of environmental estrogenic compounds on alligator bones, it supports previous laboratory-based studies in rodents. Further, this study is important in demonstrating that the alterations in morphology and physiology induced in free-ranging individuals living in environments contaminated with endocrine-active compounds are not limited to a few systems or tissues; rather, effects can be observed in many tissues affected by these hormones."
1349,2004,Abnormal systemic venous connection possibly associated with a persistent right umbilical vein; a case report,BackgroundAbnormal venous connections involving a persistent right umbilical vein are rare. In a minority of cases the liver is entirely bypassed and the condition is associated with multiple congenital malformations.Case presentationThe described case illustrates a systemic venous drainage that was severely abnormal in a newborn girl with a truncus arteriosus type II congenital heart defect. Injection of contrast medium through the umbilical vein catheter revealed a very peculiar venous connection that passed anterio-laterally through the right hemithorax before crossing in an oblique fashion towards the superior vena cava.ConclusionsThis venous drainage may be the result of a persistent right umbilical vein connecting with the superior vena cava.
1350,2004,A brief visual primer for the mapping of mortality trend data,"Maps are increasingly used to visualize and analyze data, yet the spatial ramifications of data structure are rarely considered. Data are subject to transformations made throughout the research process and then used to map, visualize and conduct spatial analysis. We used mortality data to answer three research questions: Are there spatial patterns to mortality, are these patterns statistically significant, and are they persistent across time? This paper provides differential spatial patterns by implementing six data transformations: standardization, cut-points, class size, color scheme, spatial significance and temporal mapping. We use numerous maps and graphics to illustrate the iterative nature of mortality mapping, and exploit the visual nature of the International Journal of Health Geographics journal on the World Wide Web to present researchers with a series of maps."
1351,2005,"11 March 2004: The terrorist bomb explosions in Madrid, Spain ‰ÛÒ an analysis of the logistics, injuries sustained and clinical management of casualties treated at the closest hospital","At 07:39 on 11 March 2004, 10 terrorist bomb explosions occurred almost simultaneously in four commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, killing 177 people instantly and injuring more than 2000. There were 14 subsequent in-hospital deaths, bringing the ultimate death toll to 191. This report describes the organization of clinical management and patterns of injuries in casualties who were taken to the closest hospital, with an emphasis on the critically ill. A total of 312 patients were taken to the hospital and 91 patients were hospitalized, of whom 89 (28.5%) remained in hospital for longer than 24 hours. Sixty-two patients had only superficial bruises or emotional shock, but the remaining 250 patients had more severe injuries. Data on 243 of these 250 patients form the basis of this report. Tympanic perforation occurred in 41% of 243 victims with moderate-to-severe trauma, chest injuries in 40%, shrapnel wounds in 36%, fractures in 18%, first-degree or second-degree burns in 18%, eye lesions in 18%, head trauma in 12% and abdominal injuries in 5%. Between 08:00 and 17:00, 34 surgical interventions were performed in 32 patients. Twenty-nine casualties (12% of the total, or 32.5% of those hospitalized) were deemed to be in a critical condition, and two of these died within minutes of arrival. The other 27 survived to admission to intensive care units, and three of them died, bringing the critical mortality rate to 17.2% (5/29). The mean Injury Severity Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores for critically ill patients were 34 and 23, respectively. Among these critically ill patients, soft tissue and musculoskeletal injuries predominated in 85% of cases, ear blast injury was identified in 67% and blast lung injury was present in 63%. Fifty-two per cent suffered head trauma. Over-triage to the closest hospital probably occurred, and the time of the blasts proved to be crucial to the the adequacy of the medical and surgical response. The number of blast lung injuries seen is probably the largest reported by a single institution, and the critical mortality rate was reasonably low."
1352,2005,12th international conference on human retrovirology: HTLV and related retroviruses,"The 12th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV and Related Retroviruses, was held at the Half Moon Hotel in Montego Bay, Jamaica, from June 22nd to June 25th 2005. The scientific conference, sponsored by the International Retrovirology Association, is held biennially at rotating international venues around the world. The meeting brings together basic scientists, epidemiologists and clinical researchers to discuss findings to prevent HTLV infection or develop new therapies against HTLV-mediated diseases. The Association fosters the education and training of young scientists to bring new approaches to the complex problems of HTLV research, such as translational research to bring findings from the laboratory into clinical trials that benefit HTLV-infected patients. The breadth and quality of research presentations and workshops at the 12th International Conference indicate that these goals are being accomplished. As HTLV research enters its third decade a new generation of scientists face many challenges. However, HTLV scientists and clinicians displayed exciting new approaches and discoveries during plenary talks and poster sessions. The conference encouraged research in HTLV infections and disease, fostered collaborations, and stimulated new partnerships between clinicians and scientists to encourage clinical trials and novel therapeutic interventions."
1353,2005,17beta-estradiol suppresses TLR3-induced cytokine and chemokine production in endometrial epithelial cells,"BackgroundThe human endometrium is an important site for contact between the host and pathogens ascending the reproductive tract, and thus plays an important role in female reproductive tract immunity. Previous work in our laboratory has suggested that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in endometrial epithelial recognition of pathogens and that ligation of endometrial TLRs results in the production of cytokines and chemokines important for both immune and reproductive functions of the endometrium. We have also demonstrated cyclic regulation of TLR3 mRNA and protein expression in human endometrium, suggesting that steroid hormones might play a role in the expression and function of TLR3. In this study, the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) on TLR3 expression and function in endometrial cell lines were investigated.MethodsEndometrial epithelial cell lines were cultured and examined for the presence of TLR3 and hormone receptors by endpoint RT-PCR. For hormonal studies, cells were pre-treated with ethanol vehicle, 10^(-8) M E2, and/or 10^(-7) M P. For antagonist assays, cells were treated with the ER antagonist, ICI 182, 780, or the PR antagonist, RU486, for two hours prior to treatment with hormones. Following hormone or hormone/antagonist pre-treatment, cells were stimulated with vehicle, the synthetic TLR3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), a negative dsDNA control, or a positive control. Cytokine and chemokine production post-stimulation was measured by ELISA. The effects of E2 and P on TLR3 mRNA and protein expression were measured using Real Time RT-PCR and FACS analysis, respectively.ResultsStimulation of TLR3-expressing cells with the synthetic TLR3 ligand, Poly I:C, resulted in the production of cytokines and chemokines important for endometrial function and regulation. Suppression of Poly I:C-induced cytokine and chemokine production by cells treated with 10^(-8) M E2, but not cells treated with 10^(-7) M P, was observed in endometrial epithelial cell lines expressing TLR3 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). The effects of E2 were not observed on cells which did not express ERalpha or in cells pre-treated with the ER antagonist, ICI 182, 780. Treatment with E2 did not affect TLR3 mRNA or protein expression. However, treatment with E2 did suppress cytokine and chemokine production resulting from TLR3 stimulation with Poly I:C, suggesting that E2 modulates TLR3 function.ConclusionThe data presented in this study are the first indication that E2 can markedly alter the innate immune response to dsRNA, providing a previously unreported process by which E2 can alter immune responses."

The percentage of eosinophils and amount of eotaxin were measured in nasal lavage 30 minutes and 24 hours after challenge. No effect could be demonstrated. The absence of an inflammatory response after (1‰ Õ3)-ë_-D-glucan application confirms earlier findings in inhalation studies."

The diastereomers interact with the oligonucleotide duplex differently. The ëÓ - [Ru(bpy)2 (m - GHK)]Cl2 is characterized by major groove binding close to the central part of the oligonucleotide, with both the peptide and the bipyridine ligand of the complex involved in the binding. The ëÈ - [Ru(bpy)2 (m - bpy - GHK)]C2 binds loosely, approaching the helix from the minor groove. The NMR analysis shows that the peptide (GHK) binding has a determinative role in the interactions of both diastereomers with the oligonucleotide."
1356,2005,23 years of the discovery of Helicobacter pylori: Is the debate over?,The Gram negative curved bacillus H. pylori has become the prize bug of all times. Barry Marshall and Robin Warren the two discoverers of this organism have been awarded with this year's Nobel Prize. The Nobel committee at the Karolinska Institute of Sweden has selected this paradigm shift discovery of 1982 as the most impacting in medical sciences. This award has surprised many as the Nobel assembly has selected this 'Robert Koch styled medical detective work' for the prize as compared to many outstanding basic research stories on the waitlist. This editorial briefly touches the significant impact of H. pylori on gastroduodenal management and the path forward as the bug has become quite controversial in recent times.
1357,2005,25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1ë±-hydroxylase expression in breast cancer and use of non-1ë±-hydroxylated vitamin D analogue,"IntroductionThe cytochrome P450 mitochondrial enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1ë±-hydroxylase (1ë±-hydroxylase) of renal tubule cells hydroxylates the major circulating form of vitamin D (25(OH)D3) to the active systemic hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. Local production of 1,25(OH)2D3 appears to occur also at other sites where 1ë±-hydroxylase is expressed for autocrine/paracrine regulation. To reduce risks of hypercalcemia during treatment with vitamin D, we have previously suggested use of non-1ë±-hydroxylated vitamin D analogues to target tissues where 1ë±-hydroxylase is expressed, including the parathyroid glands in secondary hyperparathyroidism. The present study was undertaken to examine expression of 1ë±-hydroxylase in breast cancer and to investigate whether a non-1ë±-hydroxylated vitamin D analogue displayed biological function. In addition, expression of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) was investigated.MethodsThe expression of 1ë±-hydroxylase, 24-hydroxylase and VDR was investigated in breast cancer specimens (n = 19) and normal breast tissues (n = 10) by immunohistochemistry and/or RT-PCR. Consecutive cryosections of 6 ë_m essentially free of immune cells were used in the analyses. The effect of vitamin D analogues on transcriptional activation was analyzed in transiently transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells.Results1ë±-hydroxylase protein was demonstrated in 79% and 100% of breast cancer specimens and normal breast, respectively. The overall relative mRNA levels of 1ë±-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase in normal breast compared to breast tumors were: 1ë±-hydroxylase, 1 å± 0.07 versus 0.7 å± 0.05, respectively (p &lt; 0.001); 24-hydroxylase, 1 å± 0.08 verus 2.1 å± 0.2, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The VDR was expressed in 95% of the tumors as expected, with mRNA levels of 1 å± 0.09 and 1.4 å± 0.12 (p &lt; 0.05) in breast cancer and normal breast, respectively. The ketoconazole-sensitive transcription activation potential of the non-1ë±-hydroxylated vitamin D analogue prodrug of EB1089 (EB1285) was demonstrated in MCF-7 cells, which express 1ë±-hydroxylase. The activity of EB1285 was about 20% of 1,25(OH)2D3.ConclusionThese results demonstrate nearly normal expression levels of 1ë±-hydroxylase, 24-hydroxylase and VDR in the majority of investigated breast cancer specimens. A non-1ë±-hydroxylated vitamin D analogue displayed activity in breast cancer cells. Such analogues may present future therapeutic options for proliferative disorders where 1ë±-hydroxylase is expressed."
1358,2005,2- and 8-alkynyl-9-ethyladenines: Synthesis and biological activity at human and rat adenosine receptors,"The synthesis of a series of 9-ethyladenine derivatives bearing alkynyl chains in 2- or 8-position was undertaken, based on the observation that replacement of the sugar moiety in adenosine derivatives with alkyl groups led to adenosine receptor antagonists. All the synthesized compounds were tested for their affinity at human and rat A1, A2A, and A3 adenosine receptors in binding assays; the activity at the human A2B receptor was determined in adenylyl cyclase experiments. Biological data showed that the 2-alkynyl derivatives possess good affinity and are slightly selective for the human A2A receptor. The same compounds tested on the rat A1 and A2A subtypes showed in general lower affinity for both receptors. On the other hand, the affinity of the 8-alkynyl derivatives at the human A1, A2A, and A2B receptors proved to be lower than that of the corresponding 2-alkynyl derivatives. On the contrary, the affinity of the same compounds for the human A3 receptor was improved, resulting in A3 selectivity. As in the case of the 2-alkynyl-substituted compounds, the 8-alkynyl derivatives showed decreased affinity for rat receptors. However, it is worthwhile to note that the 8-phenylethynyl-9-ethyladenine was the most active compound of the two series (Ki in the nanomolar range) at both the human and rat A3 subtype. Docking experiments of the 2- and 8-phenylethynyl-9-ethyladenines, at a rhodopsin-based homology model, gave a rational explanation of the preference of the human A3 receptor for the 8-substituted compound."
1359,2005,2Statistically significant dependence of the Xaa-Pro peptide bond conformation on secondary structure and amino acid sequence,"BackgroundA reliable prediction of the Xaa-Pro peptide bond conformation would be a useful tool for many protein structure calculation methods. We have analyzed the Protein Data Bank and show that the combined use of sequential and structural information has a predictive value for the assessment of the cis versus trans peptide bond conformation of Xaa-Pro within proteins. For the analysis of the data sets different statistical methods such as the calculation of the Chou-Fasman parameters and occurrence matrices were used. Furthermore we analyzed the relationship between the relative solvent accessibility and the relative occurrence of prolines in the cis and in the trans conformation.ResultsOne of the main results of the statistical investigations is the ranking of the secondary structure and sequence information with respect to the prediction of the Xaa-Pro peptide bond conformation. We observed a significant impact of secondary structure information on the occurrence of the Xaa-Pro peptide bond conformation, while the sequence information of amino acids neighboring proline is of little predictive value for the conformation of this bond.ConclusionIn this work, we present an extensive analysis of the occurrence of the cis and trans proline conformation in proteins. Based on the data set, we derived patterns and rules for a possible prediction of the proline conformation. Upon adoption of the Chou-Fasman parameters, we are able to derive statistically relevant correlations between the secondary structure of amino acid fragments and the Xaa-Pro peptide bond conformation."

1363,2005,5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) attenuates the expression of LPS- and Aë_ peptide-induced inflammatory mediators in astroglia,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) pathology shows characteristic 'plaques' rich in amyloid beta (Aë_) peptide deposits. Inflammatory process-related proteins such as pro-inflammatory cytokines have been detected in AD brain suggesting that an inflammatory immune reaction also plays a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Glial cells in culture respond to LPS and Aë_ stimuli by upregulating the expression of cytokines TNF-ë±, IL-1ë_, and IL-6, and also the expression of proinflammatory genes iNOS and COX-2. We have earlier reported that LPS/Aë_ stimulation-induced ceramide and ROS generation leads to iNOS expression and nitric oxide production in glial cells. The present study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective function of AICAR (a potent activator of AMP-activated protein kinase) in blocking the pro-oxidant/proinflammatory responses induced in primary glial cultures treated with LPS and Aë_ peptide.MethodsTo test the anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant functions of AICAR, we tested its inhibitory potential in blocking the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS, expression of COX-2, generation of ROS, and associated signaling following treatment of glial cells with LPS and Aë_ peptide. We also investigated the neuroprotective effects of AICAR against the effects of cytokines and inflammatory mediators (released by the glia), in blocking neurite outgrowth inhibition, and in nerve growth factor-(NGF) induced neurite extension by PC-12 cells.ResultsAICAR blocked LPS/Aë_-induced inflammatory processes by blocking the expression of proinflammatory cytokine, iNOS, COX-2 and MnSOD genes, and by inhibition of ROS generation and depletion of glutathione in astroglial cells. AICAR also inhibited down-stream signaling leading to the regulation of transcriptional factors such as NFë¼B and C/EBP which are critical for the expression of iNOS, COX-2, MnSOD and cytokines (TNF-ë±/IL-1ë_ and IL-6). AICAR promoted NGF-induced neurite growth and reduced neurite outgrowth inhibition in PC-12 cells treated with astroglial conditioned medium.ConclusionThe observed anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant and neuroprotective functions of AICAR suggest it as a viable candidate for use in treatment of Alzheimer's disease."
1364,2005,5-Halogenated pyrimidine lesions within a CpG sequence context mimic 5-methylcytosine by enhancing the binding of the methyl-CpG-binding domain of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2),"Perturbations in cytosine methylation signals are observed in the majority of human tumors; however, it is as yet unknown how methylation patterns become altered. Epigenetic changes can result in the activation of transforming genes as well as in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. We report that methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBPs), specific for methyl-CpG dinucleotides, bind with high affinity to halogenated pyrimidine lesions, previously shown to result from peroxidase-mediated inflammatory processes. Emerging data suggest that the initial binding of MBPs to methyl-CpG sequences may be a seeding event that recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes and DNA methyltransferase, initiating a cascade of events that result in gene silencing. MBD4, a protein with both methyl-binding and glycosylase activity demonstrated repair activity against a series of 5-substituted pyrimidines, with the greatest efficiency against 5-chlorouracil, but undetectable activity against 5-chlorocytosine. The data presented here suggest that halogenated pyrimidine damage products can potentially accumulate and mimic endogenous methylation signals."
1365,2005,8-Methyl-2‰Û_-deoxyguanosine incorporation into parallel DNA quadruplex structures,"This paper concerns the Circular Dichroism (CD) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structural studies of the quadruple helix arrangements adopted by three tailored oligodeoxyribonucleotide analogues, namely d(TGMeGGT), d(TGGMeGT) and d(TGGGMeT), where dGMe represents a 8-methyl-2‰Û_-deoxyguanosine residue. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the effects of the incorporation of dGMe instead of a dG residue are strongly dependant upon the positioning of a single base replacement along the sequence. As such, d(TGMeGGT), d(TGGMeGT) have been found to form 4-fold symmetric quadruplexes with all strands parallel and equivalent to each other, each more stable than their natural counterpart. NMR experiments clearly indicate that [d(TGMeGGT)]4 possesses a GMe-tetrad with all dGMe residues in a syn-glycosidic conformation while an anti-arrangement is apparent for the four dGMe of [d(TGGMeGT)]4. As the two complexes show a quite different CD behaviour, a possible relationship between the presence of residues adopting syn-glycosidic conformations and CD profiles is briefly discussed. As far as d(TGGGMeT) is concerned, NMR data indicate that at 25å¡C it exists primarily as a single-strand conformation in equilibrium with minor amounts of a quadruplex structure."
1366,2005,8-Oxoguanine incorporation into DNA repeats in vitro and mismatch recognition by MutSë±,
1367,2005,8-Oxoguanine incorporation into DNA repeats in vitro and mismatch recognition by MutSë±,"DNA 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) causes transversions and is also implicated in frameshifts. We previously identified the dNTP pool as a likely source of mutagenic DNA 8-oxoG and demonstrated that DNA mismatch repair prevented oxidation-related frameshifts in mononucleotide repeats. Here, we show that both Klenow fragment and DNA polymerase ë± can utilize 8-oxodGTP and incorporate the oxidized purine into model frameshift targets. Both polymerases incorporated 8-oxodGMP opposite C and A in repetitive DNA sequences and efficiently extended a terminal 8-oxoG. The human MutSë± mismatch repair factor recognized DNA 8-oxoG efficiently in some contexts that resembled frameshift intermediates in the same C or A repeats. DNA 8-oxoG in other slipped/mispaired structures in the same repeats adopted configurations that prevented recognition by MutSë± and by the OGG1 DNA glycosylase thereby rendering it invisible to DNA repair. These findings are consistent with a contribution of oxidative DNA damage to frameshifts. They also suggest how mismatch repair might reduce the burden of DNA 8-oxoG and prevent frameshift formation."
1368,2005,"8-vinyl-deoxyadenosine, an alternative fluorescent nucleoside analog to 2‰Û_-deoxyribosyl-2-aminopurine with improved properties","We report here the synthesis and the spectroscopic characterization of 8-vinyl-deoxyadenosine (8vdA), a new fluorescent analog of deoxyadenosine. 8vdA was found to absorb and emit in the same wavelength range as 2‰Û_-deoxyribosyl-2-aminopurine (2AP), the most frequently used fluorescent nucleoside analog. Though the quantum yield of 8vdA is similar to that of 2AP, its molar absorption coefficient is about twice, enabling a more sensitive detection. Moreover, the fluorescence of 8vdA was found to be sensitive to temperature and solvent but not to pH (around neutrality) or coupling to phosphate groups. Though 8vdA is base sensitive and susceptible to depurination, the corresponding phosphoramidite was successfully prepared and incorporated in oligonucleotides of the type d(CGT TTT XNX TTT TGC) where N = 8vdA and X = A, T or C. The 8vdA-labeled oligonucleotides gave more stable duplexes than the corresponding 2AP-labeled sequences when X = A or T, indicating that 8vdA is less perturbing than 2AP and probably adopts an anti conformation to preserve the Watson‰ÛÒCrick H-bonding. In addition, the quantum yield of 8vdA is significantly higher than 2AP in all tested oligonucleotides in both their single strand and duplex states. The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence parameters of 8vdA and 2AP were found to depend similarly on the nature of their flanking residues and on base pairing, suggesting that their photophysics are governed by similar mechanisms. Taken together, our data suggest that 8vdA is a non perturbing nucleoside analog that may be used with improved sensitivity for the same applications as 2AP."
1369,2005,A2B adenosine receptor activity is reduced in neutrophils from patients with systemic sclerosis,"We conducted the present study to investigate protein expression and functioning of A2A and A2B adenosine receptors (ARs) in neutrophils of patients affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc). The presence of A2A and A2B ARs was assessed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Equilibrium A2A and A2B ARs binding parameters were evaluated by radioligand binding assay. Functional studies were conducted to investigate coupling of the A2B AR to the adenylyl cyclase pathway. This is the first report of the use of Western blot analysis to confirm the presence of A2A and A2B ARs in human neutrophils. No significant changes in A2A AR binding parameters or expression levels were detected between SSc patients and healthy control individuals. A significant decrease (65%) in the maximum density of A2B AR binding sites occurred in SSc neutrophils, whereas no changes in the affinity constant values were found. Moreover, a decrease in A2B AR mediated adenylyl cyclase activity was observed in patients with SSc. Our findings demonstrate the occurrence of selective alterations in A2B AR density and signalling in SSc."
1370,2005,A2 gene of Old World cutaneous Leishmania is a single highly conserved functional gene,"BackgroundLeishmaniases are among the most proteiform parasitic infections in humans ranging from unapparent to cutaneous, mucocutaneous or visceral diseases. The various clinical issues depend on complex and still poorly understood mechanisms where both host and parasite factors are interacting. Among the candidate factors of parasite virulence are the A2 genes, a family of multiple genes that are developmentally expressed in species of the Leishmania donovani group responsible for visceral diseases (VL). By contrast, in L. major determining cutaneous infections (CL) we showed that A2 genes are present in a truncated form only. Furthermore, the A2 genomic sequences of L. major were considered subsequently to represent non-expressed pseudogenes [1]. Consequently, it was suggested that the structural and functional properties of A2 genes could play a role in the differential tropism of CL and VL leishmanias. On this basis, it was of importance to determine whether the observed structural/functional particularities of the L. major A2 genes were shared by other CL Leishmania, therefore representing a proper characteristic of CL A2 genes as opposed to those of VL isolates.MethodsIn the present study we amplified by PCR and sequenced the A2 genes from genomic DNA and from clonal libraries of the four Old World CL species comparatively to a clonal population of L. infantum VL parasites. Using RT-PCR we also amplified and sequenced A2 mRNA transcripts from L. major.ResultsA unique A2 sequence was identified in Old World cutaneous Leishmania by sequencing. The shared sequence was highly conserved among the various CL strains and species analysed, showing a single polymorphism C/G at position 58. The CL A2 gene was found to be functionally transcribed at both parasite stages.ConclusionThe present study shows that cutaneous strains of leishmania share a conserved functional A2 gene. As opposed to the multiple A2 genes described in VL isolates, the CL A2 gene is unique, lacking most of the nucleotide repeats that constitute the variable region at the 5'end of the VL A2 sequences. As the variable region of the VL A2 gene has been shown to correspond to a portion of the protein which is highly immunogenic, the present results support the hypothesis of a possible role of the A2 gene in the differential tropism of CL and VL leishmania parasites."
1371,2005,A 2-year prospective study of patient-relevant outcomes in patients operated on for knee osteoarthritis with tibial osteotomy,"BackgroundTibial osteotomy is a treatment for younger and/or physically active patients suffering from uni-compartmental knee osteoarthritis. The open wedge osteotomy by the hemicallotasis technique includes the use of external fixation. The use of external fixation has several advantages, as early mobilization and the opportunity for optimal correction. However, the hemicallotasis technique has also been described as a cumbersome procedure for the patient. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate patient-relevant outcomes during the first 2 post-operative years. Especially the treatment period, during which external fixation was used, was closely monitored.MethodsIn an uncontrolled study, fifty-eight consecutive patients, 30 men and 28 women (mean age 54 years) were operated on by the hemicallotasis technique were evaluated with the patient-relevant outcome measure Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) preoperatively, during the treatment with external fixation, one week after removal of the external fixation, at 6 months, and at one and two years postoperatively.ResultsAt the 2-year postoperative follow-up, all subscales of the KOOS were improved (p &lt; 0.001), mostly in pain (41‰ÛÒ80 on a 0‰ÛÒ100 worst to best scale) and knee-related quality of life (21‰ÛÒ61 on a 0‰ÛÒ100 worst to best scale), compared to the preoperative status. Significant improvements in pain and other symptoms, function of daily life and quality of life were seen already during the treatment period (mean 98 å± 18 days) with the external fixation. More demanding functions such as kneeling, squatting, jumping and running, were improved first after extraction of the external fixation device and the pins.ConclusionTibial osteotomy by the hemicallotasis technique yields large improvement in self-rated pain, function and quality of life, which persists over two years. Surprisingly, large improvements occurred already during the immediate post-operative period when the external fixation was still used."
1372,2005,A 4 Mb High Resolution BAC Contig on Bovine Chromosome 1q12 and Comparative Analysis With Human Chromosome 21q22,"The bovine RPCI-42 BAC library was screened to construct a sequence-ready ~4 Mb single contig of 92 BAC clones on BTA 1q12. The contig covers the region between the genes KRTAP8P1 and CLIC6. This genomic segment in cattle is of special interest as it contains the dominant gene responsible for the hornless or polled phenotype in cattle. The construction of the BAC contig was initiated by screening the bovine BAC library with heterologous cDNA probes derived from 12 human genes of the syntenic region on HSA 21q22. Contig building was facilitated by BAC end sequencing and chromosome walking. During the construction of the contig, 165 BAC end sequences and 109 single-copy STS markers were generated. For comparative mapping of 25 HSA 21q22 genes, genomic PCR primers were designed from bovine EST sequences and the gene-associated STSs mapped on the contig. Furthermore, bovine BAC end sequence comparisons against the human genome sequence revealed significant matches to HSA 21q22 and allowed the in silico mapping of two new genes in cattle. In total, 31 orthologues of human genes located on HSA 21q22 were directly mapped within the bovine BAC contig, of which 16 genes have been cloned and mapped for the first time in cattle. In contrast to the existing comparative bovine‰ÛÒhuman RH maps of this region, these results provide a better alignment and reveal a completely conserved gene order in this 4 Mb segment between cattle, human and mouse. The mapping of known polled linked BTA 1q12 microsatellite markers allowed the integration of the physical contig map with existing linkage maps of this region and also determined the exact order of these markers for the first time. Our physical map and transcript map may be useful for positional cloning of the putative polled gene in cattle. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper have been submitted to EMBL and have been assigned Accession Numbers AJ698510‰ÛÒAJ698674."

1374,2005,A 63 element 1.75 dimensional ultrasound phased array for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia,"BackgroundProstate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are very common diseases in older American men, thus having a reliable treatment modality for both diseases is of great importance. The currently used treating options, mainly surgical ones, have numerous complications, which include the many side effects that accompany such procedures, besides the invasive nature of such techniques. Focused ultrasound is a relatively new treating modality that is showing promising results in treating prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus this technique is gaining more attention in the past decade as a non-invasive method to treat both diseases.MethodsIn this paper, the design, construction and evaluation of a 1.75 dimensional ultrasound phased array to be used for treating prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia is presented. With this array, the position of the focus can be controlled by changing the electrical power and phase to the individual elements for electronically focusing and steering in a three dimensional volume. The array was designed with a maximum steering angle of å± 13.5å¡ in the transverse direction and a maximum depth of penetration of 11 cm, which allows the treatment of large prostates. The transducer piezoelectric ceramic, matching layers and cable impedance have been designed for maximum power transfer to tissue.ResultsTo verify the capability of the transducer for focusing and steering, exposimetry was performed and the results correlated well with the calculated field. Ex vivo experiments using bovine tissue were performed with various lesion sizes and indicated the capability of the transducer to ablate tissue using short sonications.ConclusionA 1.75 dimensional array, that overcame the drawbacks associated with one-dimensional arrays, has been designed, built and successfully tested. Design issues, such as cable and ceramic capacitances, were taken into account when designing this array. The final prototype overcame also the problem of generating grating lobes at unwanted locations by tapering the array elements."

1376,2005,A 6-months assessment of the alcohol-related clinical burden at emergency rooms (ERs) in 11 acute care hospitals of an urban area in Germany,"BackgroundThe purpose of the study was to identify and to profile alcohol-related attendances to emergency rooms (ERs) of 11 hospitals of various medical specialties covering a large urban population, to assess risk factors associated with short-stay cases, repeat attendances and higher degree of alcohol consumption and to estimate their impact on the alcohol-related burden at ERs.MethodsA 6-months study was carried out to obtain clinical and administrative data on single and multiple attendances at ERs in 11 governmental acute hospitals in a large city in Germany. All alcohol-related attendances at ERs of study hospitals were eligible. A broad definition of alcohol-related attendances independently from alcohol diagnosis and various demographic, clinical and administrative measures were used. Odds ratios for the associations of these measures with duration of stay, repeat attendances and higher degrees of alcohol consumption were derived from multivariate binomial and multinomial logistic regression models.Results1,748 patients with symptoms of alcohol consumption or withdrawal (inclusion rate 83.8%) yielded 2,372 attendances (3% of all medical admissions), and resulted in 12,629 inpatient-days. These patients accounted for 10.7 cases per 1,000 inhabitants. The average duration of inpatient stay was 10 days. 1,451 of all patients (83%) presented once, whereas the median of repeat attendances was three for the remaining 297 patients. Short-stay cases (&lt;24 hours) were significantly linked with male gender, alcohol misuse, trauma (or suspicion of a trauma) and medical specialties. Increased levels of alcohol consumption at first attendance were significantly associated with repeat attendances in due course. In a multinomial logistic regression model higher degrees of alcohol consumption were significantly associated with male gender, trauma, short-stays, attendance outside regular working time, and with repeat attendances and self-discharge.ConclusionApart from demographic factors, the alcohol-related clinical burden is largely determined by short-stay cases, repeat attendances and cases with higher levels of alcohol consumption at first attendance varying across medical specialties. These findings could be relevant for the planning of anti-alcoholic interventions at ERs."

1378,2005,"A7DB: a relational database for mutational, physiological and pharmacological data related to the ë±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","BackgroundNicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric proteins that are important drug targets for a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and various forms of epilepsy. One of the most intensively studied nAChR subunits in recent years has been ë±7. This subunit can form functional homomeric pentamers (ë±7)5, which can make interpretation of physiological and structural data much simpler. The growing amount of structural, pharmacological and physiological data for these receptors indicates the need for a dedicated and accurate database to provide a means to access this information in a coherent manner.DescriptionA7DB is a new relational database of manually curated experimental physiological data associated with the ë±7 nAChR. It aims to store as much of the pharmacology, physiology and structural data pertaining to the ë±7 nAChR. The data is accessed via web interface that allows a user to search the data in multiple ways: 1) a simple text query 2) an incremental query builder 3) an interactive query builder and 4) a file-based uploadable query. It currently holds more than 460 separately reported experiments on over 85 mutations.ConclusionsA7DB will be a useful tool to molecular biologists and bioinformaticians not only working on the ë±7 receptor family of proteins but also in the more general context of nicotinic receptor modelling. Furthermore it sets a precedent for expansion with the inclusion of all nicotinic receptor families and eventually all cys-loop receptor families."

Subjects were assigned to ABC (300 mg twice daily)/ EFV (600 mg once daily)/ ddI (400 mg once daily) plus HU (500 mg twice daily) (n = 30) or this regimen without HU (n = 24).ResultsBaseline mean HIV-1 RNA was 3.86 log10 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count was 345 cells/mm3. A similar percentage of subjects in the non-HU arm (58%) and HU arm (53%) completed the study. Intent-to-treat: missing = failure analysis showed no differences in proportions of subjects in the non-HU and HU arms achieving undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at week 24 (&lt;400 copies/mL: 58% [14/24] vs 57% [17/30], P = 0.899; &lt;50 copies/mL (50% [12/24] vs 47% [14/30], P = 0.780). Median change from baseline in CD4+ cell count in the non-HU and HU arms at week 48 was +114 cells/mm3 and -63 cells/mm3 (P = 0.007), respectively. Both regimens were generally well tolerated, although more subjects in the HU arm withdrew prematurely from the study due to adverse events (23% vs 4%). Four cases of possible ABC-related hypersensitivity were observed.ConclusionABC/EFV/ddI was an effective and well-tolerated second-line regimen for nucleoside/PI-experienced HIV-infected subjects. The addition of HU blunted the CD4+ cell response, did not appear to enhance antiviral activity, and resulted in more treatment-limiting adverse events."
1384,2005,A BAC-based physical map of the Nile tilapia genome,"BackgroundCichlid fishes, particularly tilapias, are an important source of animal protein in tropical countries around the world. To support selective breeding of these species we are constructing genetic and physical maps of the tilapia genome. Physical maps linking collections of BAC clones are a critical resource for both positional cloning and assembly of whole genome sequences.ResultsWe constructed a genome-wide physical map of the tilapia genome by restriction fingerprinting 35,245 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones using high-resolution capillary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The map consists of 3,621 contigs and is estimated to span 1.752 Gb in physical length. An independent analysis of the marker content of four contigs demonstrates the reliability of the assembly.ConclusionThis physical map is a powerful tool for accelerating genomic studies in cichlid fishes, including comparative mapping among fish species, long-range assembly of genomic shotgun sequences, and the positional cloning of genes underlying important phenotypic traits.

1385,2005,"A Bacillus thuringiensis isolation method utilizing a novel stain, low selection and high throughput produced atypical results","BackgroundBacillus thuringiensis is a bacterium known for producing protein crystals with insecticidal properties. These toxins are widely sought after for controlling agricultural pests due to both their specificity and their applicability in transgenic plants. There is great interest in isolating strains with improved or novel toxin characteristics, however isolating B. thuringiensis from the environment is time consuming and yields relatively few isolates of interest. New approaches to B. thuringiensis isolation have been, and continue to be sought. In this report, candidate B. thuringiensis isolates were recovered from environmental samples using a combination of a novel stain, high throughput and reduced selection. Isolates were further characterized by SDS-PAGE, light microscopy, PCR, probe hybridization, and with selected isolates, DNA sequencing, bioassay or Electron Microscopy.ResultsBased on SDS-PAGE patterns and the presence of cry genes or a crystal, 79 candidate, non-clonal isolates of B. thuringiensis were identified from 84 samples and over 10,000 colonies. Although only 16/79 (20%) of the isolates showed DNA homology by Probe Hybridization or PCR to common cry genes, initial characterization revealed a surprisingly rich library that included a putative nematocidal gene, a novel filamentous structure associated with a crystal, a spore with spikes originating from a very small parasporal body and isolates with unusually small crystals. When compared to reports of other screens, this screen was also atypical in that only 3/79 isolates (3.8%) produced a bipyramidal crystal and 24/79 (30%) of the isolates' spores possessed an attached, dark-staining body.ConclusionResults suggest that the screening methodology adopted in this study might deliver a vastly richer and potentially more useful library of B. thuringiensis isolates as compared to that obtained with commonly reported methodologies, and that by extension, methodologies fundamentally different from current methods should also be explored."
1386,2005,A balanced review of the status T cell-based therapy against cancer,"A recent commentary stirred intense controversy over the status of anti-cancer immunotherapy. The commentary suggested moving beyond current anti-cancer vaccines since active-specific immunization failed to match expectations toward a more aggressive approach involving the adoptive transfer of in vitro expanded tumor antigen-specific T cells. Although the same authors clarified their position in response to others' rebuttal more discussion needs to be devoted to the current status of T cell-based anti-cancer therapy. The accompanying publications review the status of adoptive transfer of cancer vaccines on one hand and active-specific immunization on the other. Hopefully, reading these articles will offer a balanced view of the current status of antigen-specific ant-cancer therapies and suggest future strategies to foster unified efforts to complement either approach with the other according to specific biological principles."
1387,2005,"A balanced transcription between telomerase and the telomeric DNA-binding proteins TRF1, TRF2 and Pot1 in resting, activated, HTLV-1-transformed and Tax-expressing human T lymphocytes","BackgroundThe functional state of human telomeres is controlled by telomerase and by a protein complex named shelterin, including the telomeric DNA-binding proteins TRF1, TRF2 and Pot1 involved in telomere capping functions. The expression of hTERT, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, plays a crucial role in the control of lymphocyte proliferation by maintaining telomere homeostasis. It has been previously found that hTERT activity is down-regulated by the human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein in HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocytes. In this study, we have examined the effects of Tax expression on the transcriptional profile of telomerase and of shelterin in human T lymphocytes.ResultsWe first provide evidence that the up-regulation of hTERT transcription in activated CD4+ T lymphocytes is associated with a down-regulation of that of TERF1, TERF2 and POT1 genes. Next, the down-regulation of hTERT transcription by Tax in HTLV-1 transformed or in Tax-expressing T lymphocytes is found to correlate with a significant increase of TRF2 and/or Pot1 mRNAs. Finally, ectopic expression of hTERT in one HTLV-1 T cell line induces a marked decrease in the transcription of the POT1 gene. Collectively, these observations predict that the increased transcriptional expression of shelterin genes is minimizing the impact on telomere instability induced by the down-regulation of hTERT by Tax.ConclusionThese findings support the notion that Tax, telomerase and shelterin play a critical role in the proliferation of HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocytes."
1388,2005,A Bayesian approach for applying Haseman-Elston methods,"The main goal of this paper is to couple the Haseman-Elston method with a simple yet effective Bayesian factor-screening approach. This approach selects markers by considering a set of multigenic models that include epistasis effects. The markers are ranked based on their marginal posterior probability. A significant improvement over our previously proposed Bayesian variable selection methodology is a simple Metropolis-Hasting algorithm that requires minimum tuning on the prior settings. The algorithm, however, is also flexible enough for us to easily incorporate our hypotheses and avoid computational pitfalls. We apply our approach to the microsatellite data of Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism using the coded values for the ALDX1 variable as our response."
1389,2005,A Bayesian genome screening of maximum number of drinks as an alcoholism phenotype with the new Haseman-Elston method,"Common human disorders, such as alcoholism, may be the result of interactions of many genes as well as environmental risk factors. Therefore, it is important to incorporate gene ÌÑ gene and gene ÌÑ environment interactions in complex disease gene mapping. In this study, we applied a robust Bayesian genome screening method that can incorporate interaction effects to map genes underlying alcoholism through its application to the data of the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism provided by Genetic Analysis Workshop 14. Our Bayesian genome screening method uses the regression-based stochastic variable selection, coupled with the new Haseman-Elston method to identify markers linked to phenotypes of interest. Compared to traditional linkage methods based on single-gene disease models, our method allows for multilocus disease models for simultaneous screening including both main and interaction (epistatic) effects. It is conceptually simple and computationally efficient through the use of Gibbs sampler. We conducted genome-wide analysis and comparison between scans based on microsatellites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. A total of 328 microsatellites and 11,560 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (by Affymetrix) on 22 autosomal chromosomes and sex chromosome were used."
1390,2005,"ABCC5, ERCC2, XPA and XRCC1 transcript abundance levels correlate with cisplatin chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines","BackgroundAlthough 40‰ÛÒ50% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors respond to cisplatin chemotherapy, there currently is no way to prospectively identify potential responders. The purpose of this study was to determine whether transcript abundance (TA) levels of twelve selected DNA repair or multi-drug resistance genes (LIG1, ERCC2, ERCC3, DDIT3, ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCC10, GTF2H2, XPA, XPC and XRCC1) were associated with cisplatin chemoresistance and could therefore contribute to the development of a predictive marker. Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, was employed to assess these genes in a set of NSCLC cell lines with a previously published range of sensitivity to cisplatin. Data were obtained in the form of target gene molecules relative to 106 ë_-actin (ACTB) molecules. To cancel the effect of ACTB variation among the different cell lines individual gene expression values were incorporated into ratios of one gene to another. Each two-gene ratio was compared as a single variable to chemoresistance for each of eight NSCLC cell lines using multiple regression. In an effort to validate these results, six additional lines then were evaluated.ResultsFollowing validation, single variable models best correlated with chemoresistance (p &lt; 0.001), were ERCC2/XPC, ABCC5/GTF2H2, ERCC2/GTF2H2, XPA/XPC and XRCC1/XPC. All single variable models were examined hierarchically to achieve two variable models. The two variable model with the highest correlation was (ABCC5/GTF2H2, ERCC2/GTF2H2) with an R2 value of 0.96 (p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionThese results provide markers suitable for assessment of small fine needle aspirate biopsies in an effort to prospectively identify cisplatin resistant tumors."
1391,2005,ABC transporter FtsABCD of Streptococcus pyogenes mediates uptake of ferric ferrichrome,"BackgroundThe Streptococcus pyogenes or Group A Streptococcus (GAS) genome encodes three ABC transporters, namely, FtsABCD, MtsABC, and HtsABC, which share homology with iron transporters. MtsABC and HtsABC are believed to take up ferric (Fe3+) and manganese ions and heme, respectively, while the specificity of FtsABCD is unknown.ResultsRecombinant FtsB, the lipoprotein component of FtsABCD, was found to bind Fe3+ ferrichrome in a 1:1 stoichiometry. To investigate whether FtsABCD transports Fe3+ ferrichrome, GAS isogenic strains defective in lipoprotein gene ftsB and permease gene ftsC were generated, and the effects of the mutations on uptake of Fe3+ ferrichrome were examined using radioactive 55Fe3+ ferrichrome. FtsB was produced in the wild-type strain but not in the ftsB mutant, confirming the ftsB inactivation. While wild-type GAS took up 3.6 ÌÑ 104 Fe3+ ferrichrome molecules per bacterium per min at room temperature, the ftsB and ftsC mutants did not have a detectable rate of Fe3+ ferrichrome uptake. The inactivation of ftsB or ftsC also decreased 55Fe3+ ferrichrome uptake by &gt;90% under growth conditions in the case of limited uptake time. Complementation of the ftsB mutant with a plasmid carrying the ftsB gene restored FtsB production and 55Fe3+ ferrichrome association at higher levels compared with the parent strain. The inactivation of mtsA and htsA and Fe-restricted conditions enhanced the production of FtsB and Fe3+ ferrichrome uptake.ConclusionThe FtsB protein bound Fe3+ ferrichrome, and inactivation of ftsB or ftsC, but not htsA or mtsA, diminished Fe3+ ferrichrome uptake, indicating that FtsABCD, but not HtsABC and MtsABC, is the transporter that takes up Fe3+ ferrichrome in GAS. Fe acquisition systems are virulence factors in many bacterial pathogens and are attractive vaccine candidates. The elucidation of the FtsABCD specificity advances the understanding of Fe acquisition processes in GAS and may help evaluating the GAS Fe acquisition systems as vaccine candidates."
1392,2005,ABC transporters as multidrug resistance mechanisms and the development of chemosensitizers for their reversal,"One of the major problems related with anticancer chemotherapy is resistance against anticancer drugs. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of transporter proteins that are responsible for drug resistance and a low bioavailability of drugs by pumping a variety of drugs out cells at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. One strategy for reversal of the resistance of tumor cells expressing ABC transporters is combined use of anticancer drugs with chemosensitizers. In this review, the physiological functions and structures of ABC transporters, and the development of chemosensitizers are described focusing on well-known proteins including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, and breast cancer resistance protein."

1394,2005,Abdominal fat and hip fracture risk in the elderly: The Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study,"BackgroundFat mass, which is a major component of body weight, is directly related to bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk. It is not known whether abdominal fat is associated with hip fracture. The present study was designed to examine the association between abdominal fat and hip fracture in women and men aged 60+ years.MethodsThis was a nested case-control study with one fracture case being matched with two controls of the same age. In women 63 cases were matched with 126 controls, and in men 26 cases were matched with 52 controls. Hip fracture was confirmed by X-ray and personal interview. Other measurements included weight, height, body mass index (BMI), abdominal fat, and femoral neck bone density (FNBMD). Conditional logistic regression model was used to analyse data.ResultsThe odds ratio of hip fracture risk associated with each 10% lower abdominal fat was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1) in women and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7 to 2.0) in men. However after adjusting for FNBMD or body weight, the abdominal fat-fracture association was no longer statistically significant. Similarly, body weight and BMI was each significantly associated with hip fracture risk (in women), but after taking with account the effect of FNBMD, the association become statistically non-significant.ConclusionLower abdominal fat was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in elderly women, but the association was not independent of FNBMD or weight. The contribution of abdominal fat to hip fracture risk is likely to be modest."
1395,2005,Abdominal surgical site infections: incidence and risk factors at an Iranian teaching hospital,"BackgroundAbdominal surgical site infections are among the most common complications of inpatient admissions and have serious consequences for outcomes and costs. Different risk factors may be involved, including age, sex, nutrition and immunity, prophylactic antibiotics, operation type and duration, type of shaving, and secondary infections. This study aimed to determine the risk factors affecting abdominal surgical site infections and their incidence at Imam Khomeini, a major referral teaching hospital in Iran.MethodsPatients (n = 802) who had undergone abdominal surgery were studied and the relationships among variables were analyzed by Student's t and Chi-square tests. The subjects were followed for 30 days and by a 20-item questionnaire. Data were collected through pre- and post-operative examinations and telephone follow-ups.ResultsOf the 802 patients, 139 suffered from SSI (17.4%). In 40.8% of the cases, the wound was dirty infected. The average age for the patients was 46.7 years. The operations were elective in 75.7% of the cases and 24.7% were urgent. The average duration of the operation was 2.24 hours, the average duration of pre-operative hospital stay 4.31 days and the average length of (pre- and post-operation) hospital stay 11.2 days. Three quarters of the cases were shaved 12 hours before the operation. The increased operation time, increased bed stay, electivity of the operation, septicity of the wound, type of incision, the administration of prophylactic antibiotic, type of operation, background disease, and the increased time lapse between shaving and operation all significantly associated with SSI with a p-value less than 0.001.ConclusionIn view of the high rate of SSI reported here (17.4% compared with the 14% quoted in literature), this study suggests that by reducing the average operation time to less than 2 hours, the average preoperative stay to 4 days and the overall stay to less than 11 days, and approximating the timing of shaving to the operation and substituting cefazolin for cefaluthin when prophylactic antibiotic is to be administered, the SSI may be reduced to a more acceptable level."
1396,2005,A benchmark of multiple sequence alignment programs upon structural RNAs,"To date, few attempts have been made to benchmark the alignment algorithms upon nucleic acid sequences. Frequently, sophisticated PAM or BLOSUM like models are used to align proteins, yet equivalents are not considered for nucleic acids; instead, rather ad hoc models are generally favoured. Here, we systematically test the performance of existing alignment algorithms on structural RNAs. This work was aimed at achieving the following goals: (i) to determine conditions where it is appropriate to apply common sequence alignment methods to the structural RNA alignment problem. This indicates where and when researchers should consider augmenting the alignment process with auxiliary information, such as secondary structure and (ii) to determine which sequence alignment algorithms perform well under the broadest range of conditions. We find that sequence alignment alone, using the current algorithms, is generally inappropriate &lt;50‰ÛÒ60% sequence identity. Second, we note that the probabilistic method ProAlign and the aging Clustal algorithms generally outperform other sequence-based algorithms, under the broadest range of applications."
1397,2005,Aberrant E-cadherin staining patterns in invasive mammary carcinoma,"BackgroundE-cadherin, a cell surface protein involved in cell adhesion, is present in normal breast epithelium, benign breast lesions, and in breast carcinoma. Alterations in the gene CDH1 on chromosome 16q22 are associated with changes in E-cadherin protein expression and function. Inactivation of E-cadherin in lobular carcinomas and certain diffuse gastric carcinomas may play a role in the dispersed, discohesive ""single cell"" growth patterns seen in these tumors. The molecular ""signature"" of mammary lobular carcinomas is the loss of E-cadherin protein expression as evidenced by immunohistochemistry, whereas ductal carcinomas are typically E-cadherin positive.Patients and methodsWe report on E-cadherin immunostaining patterns in five cases of invasive mammary carcinomaResultsThese were five exceptional instances in which the E-cadherin immunophenotype did not correspond to the apparent histologic classification of the lesion. These cases which are exceedingly rare in our experience are the subject of this report.ConclusionFindings such as those illustrated in this study occur in virtually all biologic phenomena and they do not invalidate the very high degree of correlation between the expression of E-cadherin and the classification of breast carcinomas as ductal or lobular type on the basis of conventional histologic criteria."
1398,2005,Aberrations of TACC1 and TACC3 are associated with ovarian cancer,"BackgroundDysregulation of the human Transforming Acidic Coiled Coil (TACC) genes is thought to be important in the development and progression of multiple myeloma, breast and gastric cancer. Recent, large-scale genomic analysis and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression data suggest that TACC1 and TACC3 may also be involved in the etiology of ovarian tumors from both familial and sporadic cases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of alterations of these TACCs in ovarian cancer.MethodsDetection and scoring of TACC1 and TACC3 expression was performed by immunohistochemical analysis of the T-BO-1 tissue/tumor microarray slide from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Tissue Array Research Program (TARP) of the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. Tumors were categorized as either positive (greater than 10% of cells staining) or negative. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and p &lt; 0.05 (single comparisons), and p &lt; 0.02 (multiple comparisons) were considered to be significant. Transgenomics WAVE high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) was used to pre-screen the TACC3 gene in constitutional DNA from ovarian cancer patients and their unaffected relatives from 76 families from the Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry. All variant patterns were then sequenced.ResultsThis study demonstrated absence of at least one or both TACC proteins in 78.5% (51/65) of ovarian tumors tested, with TACC3 loss observed in 67.7% of tumors. The distribution pattern of expression of the two TACC proteins was different, with TACC3 loss being more common in serous papillary carcinoma compared with clear cell carcinomas, while TACC1 staining was less frequent in endometroid than in serous papillary tumor cores. In addition, we identified two constitutional mutations in the TACC3 gene in patients with ovarian cancer from the Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry. These patients had previously tested negative for mutations in known ovarian cancer predisposing genes.ConclusionWhen combined, our data suggest that aberrations of TACC genes, and TACC3 in particular, underlie a significant proportion of ovarian cancers. Thus, TACC3 could be a hitherto unknown endogenous factor that contributes to ovarian tumorigenesis."
1399,2005,A bi-functional siRNA construct induces RNA interference and also primes PCR amplification for its own quantification,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a process of post-transcriptional gene silencing initiated by double-stranded RNAs, including short interfering RNA (siRNA). Silencing is sequence-specific and RNAi has rapidly become central to the study of gene function. RNAi also carries promise for selective silencing of viral and endogenous genes causal for disease. To detect the very low levels of siRNA effective for RNAi we modified the 3‰Û_ end of the sense strand of siRNA with a nuclease-resistant DNA hairpin. We show that the modified siRNA-DNA construct (termed ‰Û÷crook‰Ûª siRNA) functions as a primer for the PCR and describe a novel, yet simple PCR protocol for its quantification (amolar levels/cell). When transfected into mammalian cells, crook siRNA induces selective mRNA knock-down equivalent to its unmodified siRNA counterpart. This new bifunctional siRNA construct will enable future in vivo studies on the uptake, distribution and pharmacokinetics of siRNA, and is particularly important for the development of siRNA-based therapeutics. More generally, PCR-based detection of siRNA carries wide-ranging applications for RNAi reverse genetics."
1400,2005,Ab initio identification of putative human transcription factor binding sites by comparative genomics,"BackgroundUnderstanding transcriptional regulation of gene expression is one of the greatest challenges of modern molecular biology. A central role in this mechanism is played by transcription factors, which typically bind to specific, short DNA sequence motifs usually located in the upstream region of the regulated genes. We discuss here a simple and powerful approach for the ab initio identification of these cis-regulatory motifs. The method we present integrates several elements: human-mouse comparison, statistical analysis of genomic sequences and the concept of coregulation. We apply it to a complete scan of the human genome.ResultsBy using the catalogue of conserved upstream sequences collected in the CORG database we construct sets of genes sharing the same overrepresented motif (short DNA sequence) in their upstream regions both in human and in mouse. We perform this construction for all possible motifs from 5 to 8 nucleotides in length and then filter the resulting sets looking for two types of evidence of coregulation: first, we analyze the Gene Ontology annotation of the genes in the set, searching for statistically significant common annotations; second, we analyze the expression profiles of the genes in the set as measured by microarray experiments, searching for evidence of coexpression. The sets which pass one or both filters are conjectured to contain a significant fraction of coregulated genes, and the upstream motifs characterizing the sets are thus good candidates to be the binding sites of the TF's involved in such regulation.In this way we find various known motifs and also some new candidate binding sites.ConclusionWe have discussed a new integrated algorithm for the ""ab initio"" identification of transcription factor binding sites in the human genome. The method is based on three ingredients: comparative genomics, overrepresentation, different types of coregulation. The method is applied to a full-scan of the human genome, giving satisfactory results."

1402,2006,10 Hz flicker improves recognition memory in older people,"Background10 Hz electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha rhythms correlate with memory performance. Alpha and memory decline in older people. We wished to test if alpha-like EEG activity contributes to memory formation. Flicker can elicit alpha-like EEG activity. We tested if alpha-frequency flicker enhances memory in older people. Pariticpants aged 67‰ÛÒ92 identified short words that followed 1 s of flicker at 9.0 Hz, 9.5 Hz, 10.0 Hz, 10.2 Hz, 10.5 Hz, 11.0 Hz, 11.5 Hz or 500 Hz. A few minutes later, we tested participants' recognition of the words (without flicker).ResultsFlicker frequencies close to 10 Hz (9.5‰ÛÒ11.0 Hz) facilitated the identification of the test words in older participants. The same flicker frequencies increased recognition of the words more than other frequencies (9.0 Hz, 11.5 Hz and 500 Hz), irrespective of age.ConclusionThe frequency-specificity of flicker's effects in our participants paralleled the power spectrum of EEG alpha in the general population. This indicates that alpha-like EEG activity may subserve memory processes. Flicker may be able to help memory problems in older people."

Precontracted specimens with and without endothelium were exposed to increasing concentration of 17ë_-estradiol (3‰ÛÒ30‰ÛÒ300‰ÛÒ3000 nmol/l) and to vehicle (0.1% v/v ethanol). We also evaluated the effects of 17ë_-estradiol on vessels before and 20 minutes after exposure to L-monomethyl-arginine and indomethacin.Results17ë_-estradiol induced a significant relaxation in all precontracted vessels (mean maximum effect: 78,6% å± 8,5). This effect was not different among the different rings and was not related to the presence of endothelium. N-monomethyl-L-arginine and indomethacin did not modify 17ë_-estradiol relaxant effect.ConclusionThe vasodilator action of the 17ë_-estradiol is similar on coronary arteries, resistance coronary arteries and arterial vessels usually employed as grafts in myocardial revascularization."
1404,2006,[18F] fluoromisonidazole and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in response evaluation after chemo-/radiotherapy of non-small-cell lung cancer: a feasibility study,"BackgroundExperimental and clinical evidence suggest that hypoxia in solid tumours reduces their sensitivity to conventional treatment modalities modulating response to ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of the present study was to show the feasibility of determining radiotherapeutically relevant hypoxia and early tumour response by ([18F] Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) and [18F]-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET.MethodsEight patients with non-small-cell lung cancer underwent PET scans. Tumour tissue oxygenation was measured with FMISO PET, whereas tumour glucose metabolism was measured with FDG PET. All PET studies were carried out with an ECAT EXACT 922/47å¨ scanner with an axial field of view of 16.2 cm. FMISO PET consisted of one static scan of the relevant region, performed 180 min after intravenous administration of the tracer. The acquisition and reconstruction parameters were as follows: 30 min emission scanning and 4 min transmission scanning with 68-Ge/68-Ga rod sources. The patients were treated with chemotherapy, consisting of 2 cycles of gemcitabine (1200 mg/m2) and vinorelbine (30 mg/m2) followed by concurrent radio- (2.0 Gy/d; total dose 66.0 Gy) and chemotherapy with gemcitabine (300‰ÛÒ500 mg/m2) every two weeks. FMISO PET and FDG PET were performed in all patients 3 days before and 14 days after finishing chemotherapy.ResultsFMISO PET allowed for the qualitative and quantitative definition of hypoxic sub-areas which may correspond to a localization of local recurrences. In addition, changes in FMISO and FDG PET measure the early response to therapy, and in this way, may predict freedom from disease, as well as overall survival.ConclusionThese preliminary results warrant validation in larger trials. If confirmed, several novel treatment strategies may be considered, including the early use of PET to evaluate the effectiveness of the selected therapy."
1405,2006,1Design of the Primary Prevention Parameters Evaluation (PREPARE) trial of implantablecardioverter defibrillators to reduce patient morbidity [NCT00279279],"BackgroundImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) therapy has been proven to be beneficial and efficacious for the treatment of serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias in primary prevention patients. However, primary prevention patients appear to have a lower incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in comparison to secondary prevention patients and consequently likely experience a higher proportion of detections due to supraventricular arrhythmias. Recent trials have demonstrated that strategic and specific programming choices reduce the number of inappropriate shocks and that anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) is an effective alternative to shock therapy for many sustained ventricular arrhythmias.MethodsThe Primary Prevention Parameters Evaluation (PREPARE) study is a multi-center cohort study, evaluating the efficacy of a pre-specified strategic profile of VT/VF detection and therapy settings in 700 primary prevention patients in an effort to safely reduce the number of shock therapies delivered. The patients, both with and without cardiac resynchronization therapy, are compared to a well-qualified set (n = 691) of historical controls derived from the MIRACLE ICD and EMPIRIC trials. This manuscript describes the design of the PREPARE study. The study results, to be presented separately, will characterize the efficacy of this programming set (PREPARE) compared with physician-tailored programming (MIRACLE ICD and EMPIRIC)."

1408,2006,"2‰Û_-Deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-ë_-d-arabinonucleic acid (2‰Û_F-ANA) modified oligonucleotides (ON) effect highly efficient, and persistent, gene silencing","To be effective in vivo, antisense oligonucleotides (AS ON) should be nuclease resistant, form stable ON/RNA duplexes and support ribonuclease H mediated heteroduplex cleavage, all with negligible non-specific effects on cell function. We report herein that AS ONs containing a 2‰Û_-deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-ë_-d-arabinonucleic acid (2‰Û_F-ANA) sugar modification not only meet these criteria, but have the added advantage of maintaining high intracellular concentrations for prolonged periods of time which appears to promote longer term gene silencing. To demonstrate this, we targeted the c-MYB protooncogene's mRNA in human leukemia cells with fully phosphorothioated 2‰Û_F-ANA‰ÛÒDNA chimeras (PS-2‰Û_FANA‰ÛÒDNA) and compared their gene silencing efficiency with AS ON containing unmodified nucleosides (PS-DNA). When delivered by nucleofection, chemically modified ON of both types effected a &gt;90% knockdown of c-MYB mRNA and protein expression, but the PS-2‰Û_F-ANA‰ÛÒDNA were able to accomplish this at 20% of the dose of the PS-DNA, and in contrast to the PS-AS DNA, their silencing effect was still present after 4 days after a single administration. Therefore, our data demonstrate that PS-2‰Û_F-ANA‰ÛÒDNA chimeras are efficient gene silencing molecules, and suggest that they could have significant therapeutic potential."

As the data complexity and the rate with which it is produced increases in the proteomics field, the need for flexible analysis software increases.Results2DDB is based on a core data model describing fundamentals such as experiment description and identified proteins. The extended data models are built on top of the core data model to capture more specific aspects of the data. A number of public databases and bioinformatical tools have been integrated giving the user access to large amounts of relevant data. A statistical and graphical package, R, is used for statistical and graphical analysis. The current implementation handles quantitative data from 2D gel electrophoresis and multidimensional liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry experiments.ConclusionThe software has successfully been employed in a number of projects ranging from quantitative liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry based analysis of transforming growth factor-beta stimulated fi-broblasts to 2D gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry analysis of biopsies from human cervix.

1411,2006,"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) neurotoxicity in rats: a reappraisal of past and present findings","Rationale3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely abused illicit drug. In animals, high-dose administration of MDMA produces deficits in serotonin (5-HT) neurons (e.g., depletion of forebrain 5-HT) that have been interpreted as neurotoxicity. Whether such 5-HT deficits reflect neuronal damage is a matter of ongoing debate.ObjectiveThe present paper reviews four specific issues related to the hypothesis of MDMA neurotoxicity in rats: (1) the effects of MDMA on monoamine neurons, (2) the use of ‰ÛÏinterspecies scaling‰Û to adjust MDMA doses across species, (3) the effects of MDMA on established markers of neuronal damage, and (4) functional impairments associated with MDMA-induced 5-HT depletions.ResultsMDMA is a substrate for monoamine transporters, and stimulated release of 5-HT, NE, and DA mediates effects of the drug. MDMA produces neurochemical, endocrine, and behavioral actions in rats and humans at equivalent doses (e.g., 1‰ÛÒ2åÊmg/kg), suggesting that there is no reason to adjust doses between these species. Typical doses of MDMA causing long-term 5-HT depletions in rats (e.g., 10‰ÛÒ20åÊmg/kg) do not reliably increase markers of neurotoxic damage such as cell death, silver staining, or reactive gliosis. MDMA-induced 5-HT depletions are accompanied by a number of functional consequences including reductions in evoked 5-HT release and changes in hormone secretion. Perhaps more importantly, administration of MDMA to rats induces persistent anxiety-like behaviors in the absence of measurable 5-HT deficits.ConclusionsMDMA-induced 5-HT depletions are not necessarily synonymous with neurotoxic damage. However, doses of MDMA which do not cause long-term 5-HT depletions can have protracted effects on behavior, suggesting even moderate doses of the drug may pose risks."
1412,2006,36 year old man presenting with pancreatitis and a history of recent commencement of orlistat case report,"BackgroundOrlistat is an anti-obesity drug licensed in the United Kingdom for 7 years. We present a case of a patient who developed pancreatitis four days after commencing orlistat.Case presentationA 36 year old man presented to hospital with acute severe pancreatitis four days after starting a course of Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor used in the treatment of obesity. A diagnosis of drug related pancreatitis was made by exclusion of other causes of pancreatitis; he was a teetotaller, had a normal serum calcium, had no family history of pancreatitis or hyperlipidaemia, no history of trauma and had no evidence of gallstones on Computerised Tomography scan (CT).ConclusionOrlistat was the only drug that had been started recently and has been associated with pancreatitis previously. We found no case reports of similar cases, however 99 cases of orlistat related pancreatitis have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but no causative link has been found in clinical trials by the drug company. It is therefore not on the list of possible complications or side effects of the drug."
1413,2006,3D Brain Segmentation Using Dual-Front Active Contours with Optional User Interaction,"Important attributes of 3D brain cortex segmentation algorithms include robustness, accuracy, computational efficiency, and facilitation of user interaction, yet few algorithms incorporate all of these traits. Manual segmentation is highly accurate but tedious and laborious. Most automatic techniques, while less demanding on the user, are much less accurate. It would be useful to employ a fast automatic segmentation procedure to do most of the work but still allow an expert user to interactively guide the segmentation to ensure an accurate final result. We propose a novel 3D brain cortex segmentation procedure utilizing dual-front active contours which minimize image-based energies in a manner that yields flexibly global minimizers based on active regions. Region-based information and boundary-based information may be combined flexibly in the evolution potentials for accurate segmentation results. The resulting scheme is not only more robust but much faster and allows the user to guide the final segmentation through simple mouse clicks which add extra seed points. Due to the flexibly global nature of the dual-front evolution model, single mouse clicks yield corrections to the segmentation that extend far beyond their initial locations, thus minimizing the user effort. Results on 15 simulated and 20 real 3D brain images demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and speed of our scheme compared with other methods."
1414,2006,3D Complex: A Structural Classification of Protein Complexes,"Most of the proteins in a cell assemble into complexes to carry out their function. It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical properties as well as the evolution of interactions between proteins. The Protein Data Bank represents an important source of information for such studies, because more than half of the structures are homo- or heteromeric protein complexes. Here we propose the first hierarchical classification of whole protein complexes of known 3-D structure, based on representing their fundamental structural features as a graph. This classification provides the first overview of all the complexes in the Protein Data Bank and allows nonredundant sets to be derived at different levels of detail. This reveals that between one-half and two-thirds of known structures are multimeric, depending on the level of redundancy accepted. We also analyse the structures in terms of the topological arrangement of their subunits and find that they form a small number of arrangements compared with all theoretically possible ones. This is because most complexes contain four subunits or less, and the large majority are homomeric. In addition, there is a strong tendency for symmetry in complexes, even for heteromeric complexes. Finally, through comparison of Biological Units in the Protein Data Bank with the Protein Quaternary Structure database, we identified many possible errors in quaternary structure assignments. Our classification, available as a database and Web server at http://www.3Dcomplex.org, will be a starting point for future work aimed at understanding the structure and evolution of protein complexes."
1415,2006,3D-conformal-intensity modulated radiotherapy with compensators for head and neck cancer: clinical results of normal tissue sparing,"BackgroundTo investigate the potential of parotic gland sparing of intensity modulated radiotherapy (3D-c-IMRT) performed with metallic compensators for head and neck cancer in a clinical series by analysis of dose distributions and clinical measures.Materials and methods39 patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck irradiated using 3D-c-IMRT were evaluable for dose distribution within PTVs and at one parotid gland and 38 patients for toxicity analysis. 10 patients were treated primarily, 29 postoperatively, 19 received concomittant cis-platin based chemotherapy, 20 3D-c-IMRT alone. Initially the dose distribution was calculated with Helax å¨ and photon fluence was modulated using metallic compensators made of tin-granulate (n = 22). Later the dose distribution was calculated with KonRad å¨ and fluence was modified by MCP 96 alloy compensators (n = 17). Gross tumor/tumor bed (PTV 1) was irradiated up to 60‰ÛÒ70 Gy, [5 fractions/week, single fraction dose: 2.0‰ÛÒ2.2 (simultaneously integrated boost)], adjuvantly irradiated bilateral cervical lymph nodes (PTV 2) with 48‰ÛÒ54 Gy [single dose: 1.5‰ÛÒ1.8]). Toxicity was scored according the RTOG scale and patient-reported xerostomia questionnaire (XQ).ResultsMean of the median doses at the parotid glands to be spared was 25.9 (16.3‰ÛÒ46.8) Gy, for tin graulate 26 Gy, for MCP alloy 24.2 Gy. Tin-granulate compensators resulted in a median parotid dose above 26 Gy in 10/22, MCP 96 alloy in 0/17 patients. Following acute toxicities were seen (å¡0‰ÛÒ2/3): xerostomia: 87%/13%, dysphagia: 84%/16%, mucositis: 89%/11%, dermatitis: 100%/0%. No grade 4 reaction was encountered. During therapy the XQ forms showed å¡0‰ÛÒ2/3): 88%/12%. 6 months postRT chronic xerostomia å¡0‰ÛÒ2/3 was observed in 85%/15% of patients, none with å¡4 xerostomia.Conclusion3D-c-IMRT using metallic compensators along with inverse calculation algorithm achieves sufficient parotid gland sparing in virtually all advanced head and neck cancers. Since the concept of lower single (and total) doses in the adjuvantly treated volumes reduces acute morbidity 3D-c-IMRT nicely meets demands of concurrent chemotherapy protocols."
1416,2006,3D geometric reconstruction of thoracic aortic aneurysms,"BackgroundThe thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a pathology that involves an expansion of the aortic diameter in the thoracic aorta, leading to risk of rupture. Recent studies have suggested that internal wall stress, which is affected by TAA geometry and the presence or absence of thrombus, is a more reliable predictor of rupture than the maximum diameter, the current clinical criterion. Accurate reconstruction of TAA geometry is a crucial step in patient-specific stress calculations.MethodsIn this work, a novel methodology was developed, which combines data from several sets of magnetic resonance (MR) images with different levels of detail and different resolutions. Two sets of images were employed to create the final model, which has the highest level of detail for each component of the aneurysm (lumen, thrombus, and wall). A reference model was built by using a single set of images for comparison. This approach was applied to two patient-specific TAAs in the descending thoracic aorta.ResultsThe results of finite element simulations showed differences in stress pattern between the coarse and fine models: higher stress values were found with the coarse model and the differences in predicted maximum wall stress were 30% for patient A and 11% for patient B.ConclusionThis paper presents a new approach to the reconstruction of an aneurysm model based on the use of several sets of MR images. This enables more accurate representation of not only the lumen but also the wall surface of a TAA taking account of intraluminal thrombus."
1417,2006,3D reconstruction and comparison of shapes of DNA minicircles observed by cryo-electron microscopy,"We use cryo-electron microscopy to compare 3D shapes of 158 bp long DNA minicircles that differ only in the sequence within an 18 bp block containing either a TATA box or a catabolite activator protein binding site. We present a sorting algorithm that correlates the reconstructed shapes and groups them into distinct categories. We conclude that the presence of the TATA box sequence, which is believed to be easily bent, does not significantly affect the observed shapes."
1418,2006,3-D reconstruction of anterior mantle-field techniques in Hodgkin's disease survivors: doses to cardiac structures,"BackgroundThe long-term dose-effect relationship for specific cardiac structures in mediastinal radiotherapy has rarely been investigated. As part of an interdisciplinary project, the 3-D dose distribution within the heart was reconstructed in all long-term Hodgkin's disease survivors (n = 55) treated with mediastinal radiotherapy between 1978 and 1985. For dose reconstruction, original techniques were transferred to the CT data sets of appropriate test patients, in whom left (LV) and right ventricle (RV), left (LA) and right atrium (RA) as well as right (RCA), left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries were contoured. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for these heart structures and results compared between techniques.ResultsPredominant technique was an anterior mantle field (cobalt-60). 26 patients (47%) were treated with anterior mantle field alone (MF), 18 (33%) with anterior mantle field and monoaxial, bisegmental rotation boost (MF+ROT), 7 (13%) with anterior mantle field and dorsal boost (MF+DORS) and 4 (7%) with other techniques. Mean å± SD total mediastinal doses for MF+ROT (41.7 å± 3.5 Gy) and for MF+DORS (42.7 å± 7.4) were significantly higher than for MF (36.7 å± 5.2 Gy). DVH analysis documented relative overdosage to right heart structures with MF (median maximal dose to RV 129%, to RCA 127%) which was siginificantly reduced to 117% and 112%, respectively, in MF+ROT. Absolute doses in right heart structures, however, did not differ between techniques. Absolute LA doses were significantly higher in MF+ROT patients than in MF patients where large parts of LA were blocked. Median maximal doses for all techniques ranged between 48 and 52 Gy (RV), 44 and 46 Gy (LV), 47 and 49 Gy (RA), 38 and 45 Gy (LA), 46 and 50 Gy (RCA), 39 and 44 Gy (LAD) and 34 and 42 Gy (LCX).ConclusionIn patients irradiated with anterior mantle-field techniques, high doses to anterior heart portions were partly compensated by boost treatment from non-anterior angles. As the threshold doses for coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis and valvular changes are assumed to be 30 to 40 Gy, cardiac toxicity must be anticipated in these patients. Thus, dose distributions in individual subjects should be correlated to the corresponding cardiovascular findings in these long-term survivors, e. g. by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging."

1420,2006,3D structure of Thermus aquaticus single-stranded DNA‰ÛÒbinding protein gives insight into the functioning of SSB proteins,"In contrast to the majority of tetrameric SSB proteins, the recently discovered SSB proteins from the Thermus/Deinoccus group form dimers. We solved the crystal structures of the SSB protein from Thermus aquaticus (TaqSSB) and a deletion mutant of the protein and show the structure of their ssDNA binding domains to be similar to the structure of tetrameric SSBs. Two conformations accompanied by proline cis‰ÛÒtrans isomerization are observed in the flexible C-terminal region. For the first time, we were able to trace 6 out of 10 amino acids at the C-terminus of an SSB protein. This highly conserved region is essential for interaction with other proteins and we show it to adopt an extended conformation devoid of secondary structure. A model for binding this region to the ìà subunit of DNA polymerase III is proposed. It explains at a molecular level the reason for the ssb113 phenotype observed in Escherichia coli."
1421,2006,3-Phosphoinositide-dependent Protein Kinase-1 (PDK1) promotes invasion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases,"BackgroundMetastasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in breast cancer with tumor cell invasion playing a crucial role in the metastatic process. PDK1 is a key molecule that couples PI3K to cell proliferation and survival signals in response to growth factor receptor activation, and is oncogenic when expressed in mouse mammary epithelial cells. We now present evidence showing that PDK1-expressing cells exhibit enhanced anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth and are highly invasive when grown on Matrigel. These properties correlate with induction of MMP-2 activity, increased MT1-MMP expression and a unique gene expression profile.MethodsInvasion assays in Matrigel, MMP-2 zymogram analysis, gene microarray analysis and mammary isografts were used to characterize the invasive and proliferative function of cells expressing PDK1. Tissue microarray analysis of human breast cancers was used to measure PDK1 expression in invasive tumors by IHC.ResultsEnhanced invasion on Matrigel in PDK1-expressing cells was accompanied by increased MMP-2 activity resulting from stabilization against proteasomal degradation. Increased MMP-2 activity was accompanied by elevated levels of MT1-MMP, which is involved in generating active MMP-2. Gene microarray analysis identified increased expression of the ECM-associated genes decorin and type I procollagen, whose gene products are substrates of MT1-MMP. Mammary fat pad isografts of PDK1-expressing cells produced invasive adenocarcinomas. Tissue microarray analysis of human invasive breast cancer indicated that PDK1pSer241 was strongly expressed in 90% of samples.ConclusionThese results indicate that PDK1 serves as an important effector of mammary epithelial cell growth and invasion in the transformed phenotype. PDK1 mediates its effect in part by MT1-MMP induction, which in turn activates MMP-2 and modulates the ECM proteins decorin and collagen. The presence of increased PDK1 expression in the majority of invasive breast cancers suggests its importance in the metastatic process."
1422,2006,454 sequencing put to the test using the complex genome of barley,"BackgroundDuring the past decade, Sanger sequencing has been used to completely sequence hundreds of microbial and a few higher eukaryote genomes. In recent years, a number of alternative technologies became available, among them adaptations of the pyrosequencing procedure (i.e. ""454 sequencing""), promising a ~100-fold increase in throughput over Sanger technology ‰ÛÒ an advancement which is needed to make large and complex genomes more amenable to full genome sequencing at affordable costs. Although several studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for sequencing small and compact microbial genomes, it was unclear how the new technology would perform in large and highly repetitive genomes such as those of wheat or barley.ResultsTo study its performance in complex genomes, we used 454 technology to sequence four barley Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones and compared the results to those from ABI-Sanger sequencing. All gene containing regions were covered efficiently and at high quality with 454 sequencing whereas repetitive sequences were more problematic with 454 sequencing than with ABI-Sanger sequencing. 454 sequencing provided a much more even coverage of the BAC clones than ABI-Sanger sequencing, resulting in almost complete assembly of all genic sequences even at only 9 to 10-fold coverage. To obtain highly advanced working draft sequences for the BACs, we developed a strategy to assemble large parts of the BAC sequences by combining comparative genomics, detailed repeat analysis and use of low-quality reads from 454 sequencing. Additionally, we describe an approach of including small numbers of ABI-Sanger sequences to produce hybrid assemblies to partly compensate the short read length of 454 sequences.ConclusionOur data indicate that 454 pyrosequencing allows rapid and cost-effective sequencing of the gene-containing portions of large and complex genomes and that its combination with ABI-Sanger sequencing and targeted sequence analysis can result in large regions of high-quality finished genomic sequences."

1424,2006,4SALE ‰ÛÒ A tool for synchronous RNA sequence and secondary structure alignment and editing,"BackgroundIn sequence analysis the multiple alignment builds the fundament of all proceeding analyses. Errors in an alignment could strongly influence all succeeding analyses and therefore could lead to wrong predictions. Hand-crafted and hand-improved alignments are necessary and meanwhile good common practice. For RNA sequences often the primary sequence as well as a secondary structure consensus is well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-RNA. Recently, some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and model both kinds of information. However, with the advent of a large amount of reliable RNA sequences together with their solved secondary structures (available from e.g. the ITS2 Database), we are faced with the problem to handle sequences and their associated secondary structures synchronously.Results4SALE fills this gap. The application allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary structure alignment for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing of aligned sequences and their secondary structures. This study describes an algorithm for the synchronous alignment of sequences and their associated secondary structures as well as the main features of 4SALE used for further analyses and editing. 4SALE builds an optimal and unique starting point for every RNA sequence and structure analysis.Conclusion4SALE, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive interface, is a comprehensive toolbox for RNA analysis based on sequence and secondary structure information. The program connects sequence and structure databases like the ITS2 Database to phylogeny programs as for example the CBCAnalyzer. 4SALE is written in JAVA and therefore platform independent.

1426,2006,52-kDa Ro/SSA epitopes preferentially recognized by antibodies from mothers of children with neonatal lupus and congenital heart block,"Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare disorder caused by the transplacental passage of maternal autoantibodies. The 52-kDa Ro/SSA antigen (Ro52) ribonucleoprotein represents an antigenic target strongly associated with the autoimmune response in mothers whose children have neonatal lupus and cardiac conduction disturbances, mainly congenital heart block. The objective of this study was to identify putative Ro52/60-kDa Ro/SSA antigen (Ro60) epitopes associated with neonatal lupus and congenital heart block. The reactivity of IgG antibodies present in the sera from mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus and SjÌ¦gren's syndrome and in the sera from asymptomatic mothers (a longitudinal study of 192 samples from 66 subjects) was investigated by ELISA using Ro52, Ro60 and 48-kDa La/SSB antigen proteins, as well as 45 synthetic peptides, 13‰ÛÒ24 residues long, of Ro52/Ro60 proteins. One to 19 samples collected before, during and after pregnancy were available for each mother. Forty-three disease controls selected randomly and normal sera were tested in parallel. Although no differences were found between SjÌ¦gren's syndrome and asymptomatic mothers of group I, who had at least one infant with neonatal lupus, and of group II, who had healthy babies only, significant differences were observed between lupus mothers from both groups. In the former group of lupus mothers, a significantly higher frequency of antibodies to Ro52 peptides 107‰ÛÒ122 and 277‰ÛÒ292 was observed. Between 18 and 30 weeks of gestation, the period of risk, there was clearly an elevated level of antibodies reacting with Ro52 peptides 1‰ÛÒ13, 277‰ÛÒ292 and 365‰ÛÒ382. Antibodies to Ro52 peptide 365‰ÛÒ382 have been shown previously to cross-react with residues 165‰ÛÒ185 of the heart 5-HT4 serotoninergic receptor, and might be pathologically important. The level of these Ro52 antibody subsets decreased at the end of pregnancy and after delivery. IgG antibodies to Ro52 peptides 1‰ÛÒ13, 107‰ÛÒ122, 277‰ÛÒ292 and 365‰ÛÒ382 may therefore represent important biomarkers to predict a complication in pregnant lupus women with Ro52 antibodies."
1427,2006,5' long terminal repeat (LTR)-selective methylation of latently infected HIV-1 provirus that is demethylated by reactivation signals,"We previously described selective hypermethylation of the 5'-long terminal repeat (LTR) of HTLV-1 provirus in vivo and in vitro. This prompted us to analyze CpG methylation of the two LTRs of the HIV provirus in chronically infected cell lines. The results demonstrate selective hypermethylation of the 5' LTR of the HIV provirus in ACH-2 cells. Moreover, induction of viral gene expression by TNF-ë± resulted in demethylation of the 5'-LTR. These results suggest that selective epigenetic modification of the 5'LTR of the HIV-1 provirus may be an important mechanism by which proviral activity is suppressed."
1428,2006,6A3-5/Osa2 is an Early Activated Gene Implicated in the Control of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Functions,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) growth plays a key role in the pathophysiology of vascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling gene transcription in VSMC remain poorly understood. We previously identified, by differential display, a new gene (6A3-5) overexpressed in proliferating rat VSMC. In this study, we have cloned the full-length cDNA by screening a rat foetal brain cDNA library and investigated its functions. The 6A3-5 protein shows 4 putative conserved functional motifs: a DNA binding domain called ARID (AT-rich interaction domain), two recently described motifs (Osa Homology Domain), and a nuclear localization signal. The deduced protein sequence was observed to be 85% identical to the recently described human Osa2 gene. Immunolabelling, using an anti-6A3-5/Osa2 monoclonal antibody, showed a nuclear localization of the 6A3-5/Osa2 protein. In addition, PDGF upregulated 6A3-5/Osa2 expression at both the transcript and protein levels in a dose and time-dependent fashion. The pattern of upregulation by PDGF was reminiscent of the early responsive gene c-fos. The PDGF-induced upregulation of 6A3-5/Osa2 and proliferation of VSMC were significantly inhibited in a dose and sequence-dependent fashion by an antisense, but not by sense, scrambled or mismatched oligonucleotides directed against 6A3-5/Osa2. In VSMC of aortas derived from hypertensive (LH) rats, 6A3-5/Osa2 is overexpressed as compared to that in normotensive (LL) rats. The 6A3-5/Osa2-gene expression is downregulated by an ACE inhibitor and upregulated by exogenous AngiotensinII in LH rats. In summary, these results indicate that 6A3-5/Osa2 is an early activated gene that belongs to a new family of proteins involved in the control of VSMC growth."
1429,2006,6-Shogaol reduced chronic inflammatory response in the knees of rats treated with complete Freund's adjuvant,"Background6-Shogaol is one of the major compounds in the ginger rhizome that may contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties. Confirmation of this contribution was sought in this study in Sprague- Dawley rats (200‰ÛÒ250 g) treated with a single injection (0.5 ml of 1 mg/ml) of a commercial preparation of complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) to induce monoarthritis in the right knee over a period of 28 days. During this development of arthritis, each rat received a daily oral dose of either peanut oil (0.2 ml-control) or 6-shogaol (6.2 mg/Kg in 0.2 ml peanut oil).ResultsWithin 2 days of CFA injection, the control group produced maximum edematous swelling of the knee that was sustained up to the end of the investigation period. But, in the 6-shogaol treated group, significantly lower magnitudes of unsustained swelling of the knees (from 5.1 å± 0.2 mm to 1.0 å± 0.2 mm, p &lt; 0.002, n = 6) were produced during the investigation period. Unsustained swelling of the knees (from 3.2 å± 0.6 mm to 0.8 å± 1.1 mm, p &lt; 0.00008, n = 6) was also produced after 3 days of treatment with indomethacin (2 mg/Kg/day) as a standard anti-inflammatory drug, but during the first 2 days of drug treatment swelling of the knees was significantly larger (11.6 å± 2.0 mm, p &lt; 0.0002, n = 6) than either the controls or the 6-shogaol treated group of rats. This exaggerated effect in the early stage of indomethacin treatment was inhibited by montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist. Also, 6-shogaol and indomethacin were most effective in reducing swelling of the knees on day 28 when the controls still had maximum swelling. The effect of 6-shogaol compared to the controls was associated with significantly lower concentration of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the blood and infiltration of leukocytes, including lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, into the synovial cavity of the knee. There was also preservation of the morphological integrity of the cartilage lining the femur compared to damage to this tissue in the peanut oil treated control group of rats.ConclusionFrom these results, it is concluded that 6-shogaol reduced the inflammatory response and protected the femoral cartilage from damage produced in a CFA monoarthritic model of the knee joint of rats."

1433,2006,A3 adenosine receptors and mitogen-activated protein kinases in lung injury following in vivo reperfusion,"IntroductionAlthough activation of A3 adenosine receptors attenuates reperfusion lung injury and associated apoptosis, the signaling pathway that mediates this protection remains unclear. Adenosine agonists activate mitogen-activated protein kinases, and these kinases have been implicated in ischemia/reperfusion injury; the purpose of this study was therefore to determine whether A3 adenosine receptor stimulation with reperfusion modulates expression of the different mitogen-activated protein kinases. In addition, we compared the effect of the A3 adenosine agonist IB-MECA with the newly synthesized, highly selective A3 adenosine receptor agonist MRS3558 on injury in reperfused lung.MethodStudies were performed in an in vivo spontaneously breathing cat model, in which the left lower lobe of the lung was isolated and subjected to 2 hours of ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion. The selective A3 adenosine receptor agonists IB-MECA (0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, or 0.3 mg/kg) and MRS3558 (0.05 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg) were administered before reperfusion.ResultsBoth A3 adenosine receptor agonists administered before reperfusion markedly (P &lt; 0.01) attenuated indices of injury and apoptosis, including the percentage of injured alveoli, wet/dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, TUNEL (in situ TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling)-positive cells, and caspase 3 activity and expression. The more pronounced effects at low doses were observed with MRS3558. Increases in phosphorylated c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 levels were observed by the end of reperfusion compared with controls. Pretreatment with the A3 agonists upregulated phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels but did not modify phosphorylated JNK and p38 levels.ConclusionThe protective effects of A3 adenosine receptor activation are mediated in part through upregulation of phosphorylated ERK. Also, MRS3558 was found to be more potent than IB-MECA in attenuating reperfusion lung injury. The results suggest not only that enhancement of the ERK pathway may shift the balance between cell death and survival toward cell survival, but also that A3 agonists have potential as an effective therapy for ischemia/reperfusion-induced lung injury."

Although the existence of this disease has been known for over 100 years our current knowledge of its pathogenesis and the pathophysiology of its related infertility remains unclear. Several reasons contribute to our lack of knowledge, the most critical being the difficulty in carrying out objective long-term studies in women. Thus, we and others have developed a model of this disease in the non-human primate, the baboon (Papio anubis). Intraperitoneal inoculation of autologous menstrual endometrium results in the development of endometriotic lesions with gross morphological characteristics similar to those seen in the human. Multiple factors have been implicated in endometriosis-associated infertility. We have described aberrant levels of factors involved in multiple pathways important in the establishment of pregnancy, in the endometrium of baboons induced with endometriosis. Specifically, we have observed dysregulation of proteins involved in invasion, angiogenesis, methylation, cell growth, immunomodulation, and steroid hormone action. These data suggest that, in an induced model of endometriosis in the baboon, an increased angiogenic capacity, decreased apoptotic potential, progesterone resistance, estrogen hyper-responsiveness, and an inability to respond appropriately to embryonic signals contribute to the reduced fecundity associated with this disease."

The sensing element is immobilized Bacillus sphaericus MTCC 5100 yielding urease enzyme. The transducer is an NH 4 + ion selective electrode in conjunction with a potentiometer. Heavy metals are potentially toxic to human beings. Nickel is associated with causing adverse health effects such as dermatitis and vertigo, in humans. Toxicity is manifested by affecting T-cell system and suppressing the activity of natural killer cells. Nickel finds applications in electroplating, coinage, electrodes, jewellery, alloys. The foods rich in Ni(II) are nuts, beans, oats, and wheat. The range of Ni(II) detection by the developed biosensor is 0.03‰ÛÒ0.68 nM (0.002‰ÛÒ0.04 ppb) with a response time of 1.5 minutes. For application, the Ni(II) effluent was procured from an electroplating industrial unit and was found to have a concentration of 100.0 ppm Ni(II). In foods, wheat flour sample was acid digested and Ni(II) was specifically complexed in the presence of other cations, and had an Ni(II) concentration of 0.044 ppm. The developed system has a reliability of 91.5% and 90.6%, respectively, for the samples and could possibly replace the existing conventional techniques of analysis."

1444,2006,A base pair at the bottom of the anticodon stem is reciprocally preferred for discrimination of cognate tRNAs by Escherichia coli lysyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases,"Although the yeast amber suppressor tRNATyr is a good candidate for a carrier of unnatural amino acids into proteins, slight misacylation with lysine was found to occur in an Escherichia coli protein synthesis system. Although it was possible to restrain the mislysylation by genetically engineering the anticodon stem region of the amber suppressor tRNATyr, the mutant tRNA showing the lowest acceptance of lysine was found to accept a trace level of glutamine instead. Moreover, the glutamine-acceptance of various tRNATyr transcripts substituted at the anticodon stem region varied in reverse proportion to the lysine-acceptance, similar to a ‰Û÷seesaw‰Ûª. The introduction of a C31‰ÛÒG39 base pair at the site was most effective for decreasing the lysine-acceptance and increasing the glutamine-acceptance. When the same substitution was introduced into E.coli tRNALys transcripts, the lysine-accepting activity was decreased by 100-fold and faint acceptance of glutamine was observed. These results may support the idea that there are some structural element(s) in the anticodon stem of tRNA, which are not shared by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that have similar recognition sites in the anticodon, such as E.coli lysyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases."
1445,2006,A Bayesian Network Driven Approach to Model the Transcriptional Response to Nitric Oxide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"The transcriptional response to exogenously supplied nitric oxide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was modeled using an integrated framework of Bayesian network learning and experimental feedback. A Bayesian network learning algorithm was used to generate network models of transcriptional output, followed by model verification and revision through experimentation. Using this framework, we generated a network model of the yeast transcriptional response to nitric oxide and a panel of other environmental signals. We discovered two environmental triggers, the diauxic shift and glucose repression, that affected the observed transcriptional profile. The computational method predicted the transcriptional control of yeast flavohemoglobin YHB1 by glucose repression, which was subsequently experimentally verified. A freely available software application, ExpressionNet, was developed to derive Bayesian network models from a combination of gene expression profile clusters, genetic information and experimental conditions."
1446,2006,ABCB1 genotypes and haplotypes in patients with dementia and age-matched non-demented control patients,"Amyloid ë_ is an in vitro substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux pump at the blood brain barrier (BBB). The Multi Drug Resistance (ABCB1) gene, encoding for P-gp, is highly polymorphic and this may result in a changed function of P-gp and may possibly interfere with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This study investigates to what extent ABCB1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs; C1236T in exon 12, G2677T/A in exon 21 and C3435T in exon 26) and inferred haplotypes exist in an elderly population and if these SNPs and haplotypes differ between patients with dementia and age-matched non-demented control patients. ABCB1 genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies were neither significantly different between patients with dementia and age-matched controls, nor between subgroups of different types of dementia nor age-matched controls. This study shows ABCB1 genotype frequencies to be comparable with described younger populations. To our knowledge this is the first study on ABCB1 genotypes in dementia. ABCB1 genotypes are presently not useful as a biomarker for dementia, as they were not significantly different between demented patients and age-matched control subjects."

Abdominal wall implantation from FNAC is rare.Case presentationWe report a female patient who presented with a right upper abdominal wall mass 3 years following a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and resection of a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from the liver. The mass proved to be a metastatic HCC; it was locally resected with safety margins. To date (20 months later) she remains well with no recurrence.ConclusionImplantation of tumor cells after FNAC for HCC is rare, but can happen. The availability of dynamic imaging of the liver should reduce the need for this technique in the diagnostic workup of patients suspected of having HCC"
1448,2006,"Aberrant 3‰Û_ splice sites in human disease genes: mutation pattern, nucleotide structure and comparison of computational tools that predict their utilization","The frequency distribution of mutation-induced aberrant 3‰Û_ splice sites (3‰Û_ss) in exons and introns is more complex than for 5‰Û_ splice sites, largely owing to sequence constraints upstream of intron/exon boundaries. As a result, prediction of their localization remains a challenging task. Here, nucleotide sequences of previously reported 218 aberrant 3‰Û_ss activated by disease-causing mutations in 131 human genes were compared with their authentic counterparts using currently available splice site prediction tools. Each tested algorithm distinguished authentic 3‰Û_ss from cryptic sites more effectively than from de novo sites. The best discrimination between aberrant and authentic 3‰Û_ss was achieved by the maximum entropy model. Almost one half of aberrant 3‰Û_ss was activated by AG-creating mutations and ‰ö_95% of the newly created AGs were selected in vivo. The overall nucleotide structure upstream of aberrant 3‰Û_ss was characterized by higher purine content than for authentic sites, particularly in position ‰öÕ3, that may be compensated by more stringent requirements for positive and negative nucleotide signatures centred around position ‰öÕ11. A newly developed online database of aberrant 3‰Û_ss will facilitate identification of splicing mutations in a gene or phenotype of interest and future optimization of splice site prediction tools."
1449,2006,Aberrant Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis of Schistosoma mansoni Glycoproteins on Host Lipoproteins,"BackgroundBilharzia is one of the major parasitic infections affecting the public health and socioeconomic circumstances in (sub) tropical areas. Its causative agents are schistosomes. Since these worms remain in their host for decades, they have developed mechanisms to evade or resist the immune system. Like several other parasites, their surface membranes are coated with a protective layer of glycoproteins that are anchored by a lipid modification.Methods and FindingsWe studied the release of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins of S. mansoni and found them in the circulation associated with host lipoprotein particles. Host cells endocytosed schistosomal GPI-anchored proteins via their lipoprotein receptor pathway, resulting in disturbed lysosome morphology. In patients suffering from chronic schistosomiasis, antibodies attacked the parasite GPI-anchored glycoproteins that were associated with the patients' own lipoprotein particles. These immunocomplexes were endocytosed by cells carrying an immunoglobulin-Fc receptor, leading to clearance of lipoproteins by the immune system. As a consequence, neutral lipids accumulated in neutrophils of infected hamsters and in human neutrophils incubated with patient serum, and this accumulation was associated with apoptosis and reduced neutrophil viability. Also, Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, released its major GPI-anchored glycoprotein VSG221 on lipoprotein particles, demonstrating that this process is generalizable to other pathogens/parasites.ConclusionsTransfer of parasite antigens to host cells via host lipoproteins disrupts lipid homeostasis in immune cells, promotes neutrophil apoptosis, may result in aberrant antigen presentation in host cells, and thus cause an inefficient immune response against the pathogen."
1450,2006,Aberrant stalk development and breakdown of tip dominance in Dictyostelium cell lines with RNAi-silenced expression of calcineurin B,"BackgroundCalcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, plays important roles in various cellular processes in lower and higher eukaryotes. Here we analyze the role of calcineurin in the development of Dictyostelium discoideum by RNAi-mediated manipulation of its expression.ResultsThe cnbA gene of Dictyostelium discoideum which encodes the regulatory B subunit (CNB) of calcineurin was silenced by RNAi. We found a variety of silencing levels of CNB in different recombinant cell lines. Reduction of CNB expression in a given cell line was correlated with developmental aberrations. Cell lines with strongly reduced protein levels developed slower than wild type cells and formed short stalks and spore heads with additional tips. Formation of short stalks results from incomplete vacuolization of prestalk cells during terminal differentiation. Expression of the stalk-specific gene ecmB was reduced in mutant cells. Aberrant stalk development is a cell autonomous defect, whereas the breakdown of tip dominance can be prevented by the presence of as low as 10% wild type cells in chimeras.ConclusionSilencing of calcineurin B in Dictyostelium by expression of RNAi reveals an unexpected link between increased intracellular calcium levels, possibly triggered by the morphogen DIF, activation of calcineurin, and the terminal stage of morphogenesis."

1452,2007,"1,1-Bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-biphenyl)methane inhibits basal-like breast cancer growth in athymic nude mice","Introduction1,1-Bis (3'-indolyl)-1-(p-biphenyl) methane (CDIM9) has been identified as a new peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-ë_ agonist that exhibits both receptor dependent and independent antitumor activities. CDIM9 has not previously been studied with respect to its effects against basal-like breast cancer. Our goal in the present study was to investigate the anti-basal-like breast tumor activity of CDIM9 in vitro and in vivo.MethodsThe effects of CDIM9 on cell protein and DNA syntheses were determined in basal-like breast cancer MDA-MB231 and BT549 cells in vitro. Maximum tolerated dose and dose-limited toxicity were determined in BalB/c mice, and antitumor growth activities were assessed in MDA-MB231 basal-like breast tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice.ResultsCDIM9 exhibited selective cell cytotoxicity and anti-proliferation effects on basal-like breast cancer lines. In MDA-MB231 cell, CDIM9 induced caveolin-1 and p27 expression, which was significantly downregulated by co-treatment with the PPAR-ë_ antagonist GW9662. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 and activating transcription factor-3 were upregulated by CDIM9 through a PPAR-ë_ independent pathway. CDIM9 (40 mg/kg daily, intraperitoneally, for 35 days) inhibited the growth of subcutaneous MDA-MB231 tumor xenografts by 87%, and produced a corresponding decrease in proliferation index. Nearly half of the treated mice (46%) had complete durable remissions, confirmed by histology. The growth of an established tumor was inhibited by CDIM9 treatment (64 mg/kg daily, intraperitoneally, for 10 days), with a mean tumor growth inhibition of 67% as compared with controls. CDIM9 induced increases in tumor caveolin-1 and p27 in vivo, which may contribute to its antitumor activity in basal-like breast cancer.ConclusionCDIM9 showed potent antiproliferative effects on basal-like breast cancer cell in tissue culture and dramatic growth inhibition in animal models at safe doses. These findings justify further development of this drug for treatment of basal-like breast cancer."
1453,2007,11C-choline vs. 18F-FDG PET/CT in assessing bone involvement in patients with multiple myeloma,"BackgroundMultiple Myeloma (MM) is a B cell neoplasm causing lytic or osteopenic bone abnormalities. Whole body skeletal survey (WBSS), Magnetic resonance (MR) and 18F-FDG PET/CT are imaging techniques routinely used for the evaluation of bone involvement in MM patients.AimAs MM bone lesions may present low 18F-FDG uptake; the aim of this study was to assess the possible added value and limitations of 11C-Choline to that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients affected with MM.MethodsTen patients affected with MM underwent a standard 11C-Choline PET/CT and an 18F-FDG PET/CT within one week. The results of the two scans were compared in terms of number, sites and SUVmax of lesions.ResultsFour patients (40%) had a negative concordant 11C-Choline and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Two patients (20%) had a positive 11C-Choline and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans that identified the same number and sites of bone lesions. The remaining four patients (40%) had a positive 11C-Choline and 18F-FDG PET/CT scan, but the two exams identified different number of lesions. Choline showed a mean SUVmax of 5 while FDG showed a mean SUVmax of 3.8 (P = 0.042). Overall, 11C-Choline PET/CT scans detected 37 bone lesions and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans detected 22 bone lesions but the difference was not significant (P = 0.8).ConclusionAccording to these preliminary data, 11C-Choline PET/CT appears to be more sensitive than 18F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of bony myelomatous lesions. If these data are confirmed in larger series of patients, 11C-Choline may be considered a more appropriate functional imaging in association with MRI for MM bone staging."
1454,2007,15d-PGJ2 induces apoptosis of mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells,"BackgroundProstaglandin (PG) production is associated with inflammation, a major feature in multiple sclerosis (MS) that is characterized by the loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes in the CNS. While PGs have been shown to have relevance in MS, it has not been determined whether PGs have a direct effect on cells within the oligodendrocyte lineage.MethodsUndifferentiated or differentiated mouse oligodendrocyte precursor (mOP) cells were treated with PGE2, PGF2ë±, PGD2 or 15-deoxy-ëÓ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2). Cell growth and survival following treatment were examined using cytotoxicity assays and apoptosis criteria. The membrane receptors for PGD2 and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)ë_, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the death mechanism were examined.ResultsPGE2 and PGF2ë± had minimal effects on the growth and survival of mOP cells. In contrast, PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 induced apoptosis of undifferentiated mOP cells at relatively low micromolar concentrations. 15d-PGJ2 was less toxic to differentiated mOP cells. Apoptosis was independent of membrane receptors for PGD2 and the nuclear receptor PPARë_. The cytotoxicity of 15d-PGJ2 was associated with the production of ROS and was inversely related to intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. However, the cytotoxicity of 15d-PGJ2 was not decreased by the free radical scavengers ascorbic acid or ë±-tocopherol.ConclusionTaken together, these results demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 is toxic to early stage OP cells, suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 may represent a deleterious factor in the natural remyelination process in MS."
1455,2007,160-fold acceleration of the Smith-Waterman algorithm using a field programmable gate array (FPGA),"BackgroundTo infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences. When searching sequence databases that may contain hundreds of millions of sequences, this algorithm becomes computationally expensive.ResultsIn this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by using FPGA-based hardware that implemented a module for computing the score of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor.ConclusionThis design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a new promising direction to seeking computation improvement of genomic database searching."
1456,2007,18q loss of heterozygosity in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer is correlated with CpG island methylator phenotype-negative (CIMP-0) and inversely with CIMP-low and CIMP-high,"Background:The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) with widespread promoter methylation is a distinct epigenetic phenotype in colorectal cancer, associated with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) and BRAF mutations. 18q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) commonly present in colorectal cancer with chromosomal instability (CIN) is associated with global hypomethylation in tumor cell. A recent study has shown an inverse correlation between CIN and CIMP (determined by MINTs, p16, p14 and MLH1 methylation) in colorectal cancer. However, no study has examined 18q LOH in relation to CIMP-high, CIMP-low (less extensive promoter methylation) and CIMP-0 (CIMP-negative), determined by quantitative DNA methylation analysis.Methods:Utilizing MethyLight technology (real-time PCR), we quantified DNA methylation in 8 CIMP-specific promoters {CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1} in 758 non-MSI-high colorectal cancers obtained from two large prospective cohorts. Using four 18q microsatellite markers (D18S55, D18S56, D18S67 and D18S487) and stringent criteria for 18q LOH, we selected 374 tumors (236 LOH-positive tumors with ‰ä´ 2 markers showing LOH; and 138 LOH-negative tumors with ‰ä´ 3 informative markers and no LOH).Results:CIMP-0 (0/8 methylated promoters) was significantly more common in 18q LOH-positive tumors (59% = 139/236, p = 0.002) than 18q LOH-negative tumors (44% = 61/138), while CIMP-low/high (1/8‰ÛÒ8/8 methylated promoters) was significantly more common (56%) in 18q LOH-negative tumors than 18q LOH-positive tumors (41%). These relations persisted after stratification by sex, location, or the status of MSI, p53 expression (by immunohistochemistry), or KRAS/BRAF mutation.Conclusion:18q LOH is correlated positively with CIMP-0 and inversely with CIMP-low and CIMP-high. Our findings provide supporting evidence for relationship between CIMP-0 and 18q LOH as well as a molecular difference between CIMP-0 and CIMP-low in colorectal cancer."
1457,2007,1Controlled evaluation of a neurofeedback training of slow cortical potentials in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),"BackgroundAlthough several promising studies on neurofeedback training in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been performed in recent years, the specificity of positive treatment effects continues to be challenged.MethodsTo evaluate the specificity of a neurofeedback training of slow cortical potentials, a twofold strategy was pursued: First, the efficacy of neurofeedback training was compared to a group training program for children with ADHD. Secondly, the extent of improvements observed in the neurofeedback group in relation to successful regulation of cortical activation was examined. Parents and teachers rated children's behaviour and executive functions before and after treatment. In addition, children underwent neuropsychological testing before and after training.ResultsAccording to parents' and teachers' ratings, children of the neurofeedback training group improved more than children who had participated in a group therapy program, particularly in attention and cognition related domains. On neuropsychological measures children of both groups showed similar improvements. However, only about half of the neurofeedback group learned to regulate cortical activation during a transfer condition without direct feedback. Behavioural improvements of this subgroup were moderately related to neurofeedback training performance, whereas effective parental support accounted better for some advantages of neurofeedback training compared to group therapy according to parents' and teachers' ratings.ConclusionThere is a specific training effect of neurofeedback of slow cortical potentials due to enhanced cortical control. However, non-specific factors, such as parental support, may also contribute to the positive behavioural effects induced by the neurofeedback training."
1458,2007,250 labels used to stigmatise people with mental illness,"BackgroundThe stigma against people with mental illness is a major barrier to help-seeking in young people for mental health problems. The objective of this study was to investigate the extent of stigma in relation to treatment avoidance in 14 year-old school students in England in relation to how they refer to people with mental illness.MethodsThis is a qualitative, cross-sectional study. The data were gathered as part of the baseline assessment for an intervention study intended to reduce stigma among 14 year old school students. The participating schools were two grammar (selective) schools and three comprehensive (non-selective) schools. At the start of the lesson, the students were asked 'What sorts of words or phrases might you use to describe someone who experiences mental health problems?' Words and terms used to refer to mental illness were enumerated. Using the grounded theory approach, words and terms were grouped in terms of their denotative and connotative meanings. Labels were then derived to capture the key themes attached by the students to the concepts of mental illness. The frequencies of occurrence for each word were also tabulated.Results400 of the 472 participating students (85%) provided 250 words and terms to describe a person with mental illness. Five themes were identified from the data. The first theme called 'popular derogatory terms' (116 items) accounted for nearly half of the words examined. The second theme occurred less often and was described as 'negative emotional state' (61 items). The third theme demonstrated the confusion of young people between physical disabilities, learning difficulties and mental health problems (38 items). The use of psychiatric diagnoses (15 items) and terms related to violence (9 items) were unexpectedly uncommon.ConclusionOur findings suggest the hypothesis that help-seeking by mentally ill young people may be improved by interventions that address both their lack of factual information about mental illness, and those which reduce their strong negative emotional reactions towards people with mental illness."
1459,2007,2‰Û_-Fluoro-4‰Û_-thioarabino-modified oligonucleotides: conformational switches linked to siRNA activity,"The synthesis of oligonucleotides containing 2‰Û_-deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-4‰Û_-thioarabinonucleotides is described. 2‰Û_-Deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-5-methyl-4‰Û_-thioarabinouridine (4‰Û_S-FMAU) was incorporated into 18-mer antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). 4‰Û_S-FMAU adopts a predominantly northern sugar conformation. Oligonucleotides containing 4‰Û_S-FMAU, unlike those containing FMAU, were unable to elicit E. coli or human RNase H activity, thus corroborating the hypothesis that RNase H prefers duplexes containing oligonucleotides that can adopt eastern conformations in the antisense strand. The duplex structure and stability of these oligonucleotides was also investigated via circular dichroism (CD)- and UV- binding studies. Replacement of the 4‰Û_-oxygen by a sulfur atom resulted in a marked decrease in melting temperature of AON:RNA as well as AON:DNA duplexes. 2‰Û_-Deoxy-2‰Û_-fluoro-4‰Û_-thioarabinouridine (4‰Û_S-FAU) was incorporated into 21-mer small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the resulting siRNA molecules were able to trigger RNA interference with good efficiency. Positional effects were explored, and synergy with 2‰Û_F-ANA, which has been previously established as a functional siRNA modification, was demonstrated."

This was cyclized into the corresponding oxadiazole 4 on refluxing in acetic anhydride. When refluxed in DMF in presence of piperidine, the corresponding 1,2,3-triazoleamine 5 was formed. The latter was acylated to 6 by addition of acetic anhydride while treatment of 5 with malononitrile gave the 1,2,3-triazolo [4,5-b]pyridine 8. Treatment of acetyl derivative 6 with DMFDMA gave enaminone 9. The enaminone 9 was coupled with benzenediazonium chloride to yield phenylazo-1,2,3-triazolo [4,5-b]pyridine 10. Trials to convert compound 14 into 1,2,3-triazolo [4,5-d]pyrimidine 15 via refluxing in AcOH/NH4OAc failed. Instead the hydrolyzed product 5 was formed."
1461,2007,2-Deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose Joint Uptake on Positron Emission Tomography Images: Rheumatoid Arthritis Versus Osteoarthritis,PurposePrevious positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown increased 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) uptake in joints of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study compares FDG uptake in joints of RA and OA patients and FDG-uptake with clinical signs of inflammation.ProceduresFDG-PET scans of hands and wrists were performed in patients with RA and primary OA. PET data were compared with clinical data.Results29% of RA joints and 6% of OA joints showed elevated FDG-uptake. The level of uptake in PET-positive OA joints was not significantly different from that in RA joints. The majority of PET results of RA joints corresponded with clinical findings. Clinical synovitis was found some OA joints with FDG-uptake.ConclusionsFDG-uptake was observed in the majority of clinically inflamed RA joints and in a few OA joints with no significant difference in uptake level. The latter may be due to secondary synovitis.
1462,2007,2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency associated with autism and mental retardation: a case report,"Background2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SBCADD) is caused by a defect in the degradation pathway of the amino acid L-isoleucine.MethodsWe report a four-year-old mentally retarded Somali boy with autism and a history of seizures, who was found to excrete increased amounts of 2-methylbutyryl glycine in the urine. The SBCAD gene was examined with sequence analysis. His development was assessed with psychometric testing before and after a trial with low protein diet.ResultsWe found homozygosity for A &gt; G changing the +3 position of intron 3 (c.303+3A &gt; G) in the SBCAD gene. Psychometric testing showed moderate mental retardation and behavioral scores within the autistic spectrum. No beneficial effect was detected after 5 months with a low protein diet.ConclusionThis mutation was also found in two previously reported cases with SBCADD, both originating from Somalia and Eritrea, indicating that it is relatively prevalent in this population. Autism has not previously been described with mutations in this gene, thus expanding the clinical spectrum of SBCADD."
1463,2007,3.0åÊT cardiovascular magnetic resonance in patients treated with coronary stenting for myocardial infarction: evaluation of short term safety and image quality,"Purpose To evaluate safety and image quality of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) at 3.0åÊT in patients with coronary stents after myocardial infarction (MI), in comparison to the clinical standard at 1.5åÊT. Methods Twenty-five patients (21 men; 55åÊå±åÊ9åÊyears) with first MI treated with primary stenting, underwent 18 scans at 3.0åÊT and 18 scans at 1.5åÊT. Twenty-four scans were performed 4åÊå±åÊ2åÊdays and 12 scans 125åÊå±åÊ23åÊdays after MI. Cine (steady-state free precession) and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE, segmented inversion-recovery gradient echo) images were acquired. Patient safety and image artifacts were evaluated, and in 16 patients stent position was assessed during repeat catheterization. Additionally, image quality was scored from 1 (poor quality) to 4 (excellent quality). Results There were no clinical events within 30åÊdays of CMR at 3.0åÊT or 1.5åÊT, and no stent migration occurred. At 3.0åÊT, image quality of cine studies was clinically useful in all, but not sufficient for quantitative analysis in 44% of the scans, due to stent (6/18 scans), flow (7/18 scans) and/or dark band artifacts (8/18 scans). Image quality of LGE images at 3.0åÊT was not sufficient for quantitative analysis in 53%, and not clinically useful in 12%. At 1.5 T, all cine and LGE images were quantitatively analyzable. Conclusion 3.0åÊT is safe in the acute and chronic phase after MI treated with primary stenting. Although cine imaging at 3.0åÊT is suitable for clinical use, quantitative analysis and LGE imaging is less reliable than at 1.5åÊT. Further optimization of pulse sequences at 3.0åÊT is essential."

1465,2007,"3‰Û_-Azido-2‰Û_,3‰Û_-dideoxynucleoside 5‰Û_-triphosphates inhibit telomerase activity in vitro, and the corresponding nucleosides cause telomere shortening in human HL60 cells","Telomerase adds telomeric DNA repeats to the ends of linear chromosomal DNA. 3‰Û_-Azido-3‰Û_-deoxythymidine 5‰Û_-triphosphate (AZTTP) is a known telomerase inhibitor. To obtain more selective and potent inhibitors that can be employed as tools for studying telomerase, we investigated the telomerase-inhibitory effects of purine nucleosides bearing a 3‰Û_-down azido group: 3‰Û_-azido-2‰Û_,3‰Û_-dideoxyguanosine (AZddG) 5‰Û_-triphosphate (AZddGTP), 3‰Û_-azido-2‰Û_,3‰Û_-dideoxy-6-thioguanosine (AZddSG) 5‰Û_-triphosphate (AZddSGTP), 3‰Û_-azido-2‰Û_,3‰Û_-dideoxyadenosine (AZddA) 5‰Û_-triphosphate (AZddATP) and 3‰Û_-azido-2‰Û_,3‰Û_-dideoxy-2-aminoadenosine (AZddAA) 5‰Û_-triphosphate (AZddAATP). Of these, AZddGTP showed the most potent inhibitory activity against HeLa cell telomerase. AZddGTP was significantly incorporated into the 3‰Û_-terminus of DNA by partially purified telomerase. However, AZddGTP did not exhibit significant inhibitory activity against DNA polymerases ë± and ë«, suggesting that AZddGTP is a selective inhibitor of telomerase.We also investigated whether long-term treatment with these nucleosides could alter telomere length and growth rates of human HL60 cells in culture. Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA prepared from cells cultured in the presence of AZddG and AZddAA revealed reproducible telomere shortening."
1466,2007,3D active workspace of human hand anatomical model,"BackgroundIf the model of the human hand is created with accuracy by respecting the type of motion provided by each articulation and the dimensions of articulated bones, it can function as the real organ providing the same motions. Unfortunately, the human hand is hard to model due to its kinematical chains submitted to motion constraints. On the other hand, if an application does not impose a fine manipulation it is not necessary to create a model as complex as the human hand is. But always the hand model has to perform a certain space of motions in imposed workspace architecture no matter what the practical application does.MethodsBased on Denavit-Hartenberg convention, we conceived the kinematical model of the human hand, having in mind the structure and the behavior of the natural model. We obtained the kinematical equations describing the motion of every fingertip with respect to the general coordinate system, placed on the wrist. For every joint variable, a range of motion was established. Dividing these joint variables to an appropriate number of intervals and connecting them, the complex surface bordering the active hand model workspace was obtained.ResultsUsing MATLAB 7.0, the complex surface described by fingertips, when hand articulations are all simultaneously moving, was obtained. It can be seen that any point on surface has its own coordinates smaller than the maximum length of the middle finger in static position. Therefore, a sphere having the centre in the origin of the general coordinate system and the radius which equals this length covers the represented complex surface.ConclusionWe propose a human hand model that represents a new solution compared to the existing ones. This model is capable to make special movements like power grip and dexterous manipulations. During them, the fingertips do not exceed the active workspace encapsulated by determined surfaces. The proposed kinematical model can help to choose which model joints could be eliminated in order to preserve only the motions important for a certain application. The study shows that all models, simplified or not, exhibit a pronounced similitude with the real hand motion, validated by the fingertips' computed trajectories. The results were used to design an artificial hand capable to make some of the hand's functions with a reduced set of degrees of freedom."
1467,2007,3D cell nuclei segmentation based on gradient flow tracking,"BackgroundReliable segmentation of cell nuclei from three dimensional (3D) microscopic images is an important task in many biological studies. We present a novel, fully automated method for the segmentation of cell nuclei from 3D microscopic images. It was designed specifically to segment nuclei in images where the nuclei are closely juxtaposed or touching each other. The segmentation approach has three stages: 1) a gradient diffusion procedure, 2) gradient flow tracking and grouping, and 3) local adaptive thresholding.ResultsBoth qualitative and quantitative results on synthesized and original 3D images are provided to demonstrate the performance and generality of the proposed method. Both the over-segmentation and under-segmentation percentages of the proposed method are around 5%. The volume overlap, compared to expert manual segmentation, is consistently over 90%.ConclusionThe proposed algorithm is able to segment closely juxtaposed or touching cell nuclei obtained from 3D microscopy imaging with reasonable accuracy."

1469,2007,"3D-MRI rendering of the anatomical structures related to acupuncture points of the Dai mai, Yin qiao mai and Yang qiao mai meridians within the context of the WOMED concept of lateral tension: implications for musculoskeletal disease","BackgroundA conceptual model of lateral muscular tension in patients presenting thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) has been recently described. Clinical improvement has been achieved by using acupuncture on points belonging to the so-called extraordinary meridians. The aim of this study was to characterize the anatomical structures related to these acupuncture points by means of 3D MRI image rendering relying on external markers.MethodsThe investigation was carried out the index case patient of the lateral tension model. A licensed medical acupuncture practitioner located the following acupuncture points: 1) Yin qiao mai meridian (medial ankle): Kidney 3, Kidney 6, the plantar Kidney 6 (Nan jing description); 2) Yang qiao mai meridian (lateral ankle): Bladder 62, Bladder 59, Bladder 61, and the plantar Bladder 62 (Nan jing description); 3) Dai mai meridian (wait): Liver 13, Gall bladder 26, Gall bladder 27, Gall bladder 28, and Gall bladder 29. The points were marked by taping a nitro-glycerin capsule on the skin. Imaging was done on a Siemens Magnetom Avanto MR scanner using an array head and body coil. Mainly T1-weighted imaging sequences, as routinely used for patient exams, were used to obtain multi-slice images. The image data were rendered in 3D modus using dedicated software (Leonardo, Siemens).ResultsPoints of the Dai mai meridian ‰ÛÒ at the level of the waist ‰ÛÒ corresponded to the obliquus externus abdominis and the obliquus internus abdominis. Points of the Yin qiao mai meridian ‰ÛÒ at the medial side of the ankle ‰ÛÒ corresponded to tendinous structures of the flexor digitorum longus as well as to muscular structures of the abductor hallucis on the foot sole. Points of the Yang qiao mai meridian ‰ÛÒ at the lateral side of the ankle ‰ÛÒ corresponded to tendinous structures of the peroneus brevis, the peroneous longus, and the lateral surface of the calcaneus and close to the foot sole to the abductor digiti minimi.ConclusionThis non-invasive MRI investigation has revealed the anatomical relations of acupuncture points belonging to 3 of the so-called extraordinary meridians. We conclude that the clinically developed ""WOMED concept of lateral tension"" is related to tendino-muscular structures."
1470,2007,3D-partner: a web server to infer interacting partners and binding models,"The 3D-partner is a web tool to predict interacting partners and binding models of a query protein sequence through structure complexes and a new scoring function. 3D-partner first utilizes IMPALA to identify homologous structures (templates) of a query from a heterodimer profile library. The interacting-partner sequence profiles of these templates are then used to search interacting candidates of the query from protein sequence databases (e.g. SwissProt) by PSI-BLAST. We developed a new scoring function, which includes the contact-residue interacting score (e.g. the steric, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions) and the template consensus score (e.g. couple-conserved residue and the template similarity scores), to evaluate how well the interfaces between the query and interacting candidates. Based on this scoring function, 3D-partner provides the statistic significance, the binding models (e.g. hydrogen bonds and conserved amino acids) and functional annotations of interacting partners. The correlation between experimental energies and predicted binding affinities of our scoring function is 0.91 on 275 mutated residues from the ASEdb. The average precision of the server is 0.72 on 563 queries and the execution time of this server for a query is ‰ö_15‰Ûäs on average. These results suggest that the 3D-partner server can be useful in protein-protein interaction predictions and binding model visualizations.

1471,2007,3-D Ultrastructure of O. tauri: Electron Cryotomography of an Entire Eukaryotic Cell,"The hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their segregation of key biological functions into discrete, membrane-bound organelles. Creating accurate models of their ultrastructural complexity has been difficult in part because of the limited resolution of light microscopy and the artifact-prone nature of conventional electron microscopy. Here we explored the potential of the emerging technology electron cryotomography to produce three-dimensional images of an entire eukaryotic cell in a near-native state. Ostreococcus tauri was chosen as the specimen because as a unicellular picoplankton with just one copy of each organelle, it is the smallest known eukaryote and was therefore likely to yield the highest resolution images. Whole cells were imaged at various stages of the cell cycle, yielding 3-D reconstructions of complete chloroplasts, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi bodies, peroxisomes, microtubules, and putative ribosome distributions in-situ. Surprisingly, the nucleus was seen to open long before mitosis, and while one microtubule (or two in some predivisional cells) was consistently present, no mitotic spindle was ever observed, prompting speculation that a single microtubule might be sufficient to segregate multiple chromosomes."
1472,2007,[3H]Adenine is a suitable radioligand for the labeling of G protein-coupled adenine receptors but shows high affinity to bacterial contaminations in buffer solutions,"[3H]Adenine has previously been used to label the newly discovered G protein-coupled murine adenine receptors. Recent reports have questioned the suitability of [3H]adenine for adenine receptor binding studies because of curious results, e.g. high specific binding even in the absence of mammalian protein. In this study, we showed that specific [3H]adenine binding to various mammalian membrane preparations increased linearly with protein concentration. Furthermore, we found that Tris-buffer solutions typically used for radioligand binding studies (50åÊmM, pH 7.4) that have not been freshly prepared but stored at 4å¡C for some time may contain bacterial contaminations that exhibit high affinity binding for [3H]adenine. Specific binding is abolished by heating the contaminated buffer or filtering it through 0.2-ë_m filters. Three different, aerobic, gram-negative bacteria were isolated from a contaminated buffer solution and identified as Achromobacter xylosoxidans, A. denitrificans, and Acinetobacter lwoffii. A. xylosoxidans, a common bacterium that can cause nosocomial infections, showed a particularly high affinity for [3H]adenine in the low nanomolar range. Structure‰ÛÒactivity relationships revealed that hypoxanthine also bound with high affinity to A. xylosoxidans, whereas other nucleobases (uracil, xanthine) and nucleosides (adenosine, uridine) did not. The nature of the labeled site in bacteria is not known, but preliminary results indicate that it may be a high-affinity purine transporter. We conclude that [3H]adenine is a well-suitable radioligand for adenine receptor binding studies but that bacterial contamination of the employed buffer solutions must be avoided."
1473,2007,3'-UTR SIRF: A database for identifying clusters of whort interspersed repeats in 3' untranslated regions,"BackgroundShort (~5 nucleotides) interspersed repeats regulate several aspects of post-transcriptional gene expression. Previously we developed an algorithm (REPFIND) that assigns P-values to all repeated motifs in a given nucleic acid sequence and reliably identifies clusters of short CAC-containing motifs required for mRNA localization in Xenopus oocytes.DescriptionIn order to facilitate the identification of genes possessing clusters of repeats that regulate post-transcriptional aspects of gene expression in mammalian genes, we used REPFIND to create a database of all repeated motifs in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of genes from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC). The MGC database includes seven vertebrate species: human, cow, rat, mouse and three non-mammalian vertebrate species. A web-based application was developed to search this database of repeated motifs to generate species-specific lists of genes containing specific classes of repeats in their 3'-UTRs. This computational tool is called 3'-UTR SIRF (Short Interspersed Repeat Finder), and it reveals that hundreds of human genes contain an abundance of short CAC-rich and CAG-rich repeats in their 3'-UTRs that are similar to those found in mRNAs localized to the neurites of neurons. We tested four candidate mRNAs for localization in rat hippocampal neurons by in situ hybridization. Our results show that two candidate CAC-rich (Syntaxin 1B and Tubulin ë_4) and two candidate CAG-rich (Sec61ë± and Syntaxin 1A) mRNAs are localized to distal neurites, whereas two control mRNAs lacking repeated motifs in their 3'-UTR remain primarily in the cell body.ConclusionComputational data generated with 3'-UTR SIRF indicate that hundreds of mammalian genes have an abundance of short CA-containing motifs that may direct mRNA localization in neurons. In situ hybridization shows that four candidate mRNAs are localized to distal neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons. These data suggest that short CA-containing motifs may be part of a widely utilized genetic code that regulates mRNA localization in vertebrate cells. The use of 3'-UTR SIRF to search for new classes of motifs that regulate other aspects of gene expression should yield important information in future studies addressing cis-regulatory information located in 3'-UTRs."

1475,2007,4D treatment planning for scanned ion beams,"At Gesellschaft fÌ_r Schwerionenforschung (GSI) more than 330 patients have been treated with scanned carbon ion beams in a pilot project. To date, only stationary tumors have been treated. In the presence of motion, scanned ion beam therapy is not yet possible because of interplay effects between scanned beam and target motion which can cause severe mis-dosage. We have started a project to treat tumors that are subject to respiratory motion. A prototype beam application system for target tracking with the scanned pencil beam has been developed and commissioned.To facilitate treatment planning for tumors that are subject to organ motion, we have extended our standard treatment planning system TRiP to full 4D functionality. The 4D version of TRiP allows to calculate dose distributions in the presence of motion. Furthermore, for motion mitigation techniques tracking, gating, rescanning, and internal margins optimization of treatment parameters has been implemented. 4D calculations are based on 4D computed tomography data, deformable registration maps, organ motion traces, and beam scanning parameters.We describe the methods of our 4D treatment planning approach and demonstrate functionality of the system for phantom as well as patient data."
1476,2007,50 years experience with Dupuytren's contracture in the Erlangen University Hospital ‰ÛÒ A retrospective analysis of 2919 operated hands from 1956 to 2006,"BackgroundDupuytren's disease (DD) is a hand disorder mainly among the northern population. In contrast it is rare in the mediterranean population. Therefore typical habits and dietetic influences have been discussed as well as genetic predisposition. Still, since the first description by Dupuytren in 1834 only little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease. Some hints were found for a higher prevalence among people with diabetes, alcohol abuse or smoking. Also, intensive manual work or hand injuries have been discussed to have an influence on DD. To our knowledge this is the largest retrospectively evaluated series of symptomatic patients published to date. The study includes patients from the last 50 years. It was performed to show possible correlations between DD and typical risk factors such as diabetes, alcohol consumption, and smoking.MethodsWe retrospectively analysed all patient records with DD documented between 1956 and 2006 in the Surgical University Hospital in Erlangen. Data acquisition was conducted by reviewing the medical records from 1956 to 2006 including data from all patients who were surgically treated because of DD.ResultsWe reviewed 2579 male and 340 female surgically treated patients with DD. More than 80% of the patients were between 40 and 70 years old. In 28.9% only the right hand was effected by DD, in 25.3% only the left hand and in 45.8% both hands. In 10.3% of all Patients suffered from Diabetes mellitus. Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between diabetes, alcoholism or smoking on the degree of DD in our patients.ConclusionMost data are consistent with previously published results from smaller, comparable retrospective studies with regard to right- or left handedness. We could not confirm a statistically significant correlation of DD with diabetes mellitus, severe alcohol consumption, heavy smoking or epilepsy and the stage of the disease as described in other studies. However, in the whole cohort of our operated patients during the last 50 years the prevalence of the above mentioned risk factors is slightly higher than in the normal population."
1477,2007,5‰Û_ flanking region of var genes nucleate histone modification patterns linked to phenotypic inheritance of virulence traits in malaria parasites,"In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum antigenic variation facilitates long-term chronic infection of the host. This is achieved by sequential expression of a single member of the 60-member var family. Here we show that the 5‰Û_ flanking region nucleates epigenetic events strongly linked to the maintenance of mono-allelic var gene expression pattern during parasite proliferation. Tri- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 peak in the 5‰Û_ upstream region of transcribed var and during the poised state (non-transcribed phase of var genes during the 48 h asexual life cycle), ‰Û÷bookmarking‰Ûª this member for re-activation at the onset of the next cycle. Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation acts as an antagonist to lysine 4 methylation to establish stably silent var gene states along the 5‰Û_ flanking and coding region. Furthermore, we show that competition exists between H3K9 methylation and H3K9 acetylation in the 5‰Û_ flanking region and that these marks contribute epigenetically to repressing or activating var gene expression. Our work points to a pivotal role of the histone methyl mark writing and reading machinery in the phenotypic inheritance of virulence traits in the malaria parasite."

1480,2007,8-epi-Salvinorin B: crystal structure and affinity at the ë¼ opioid receptor,"There have been many reports of epimerization of salvinorins at C-8 under basic conditions, but little evidence has been presented to establish the structure of these compounds. We report here the first crystal structure of an 8-epi-salvinorin or derivative: the title compound, 2b. The lactone adopts a boat conformation with the furan equatorial. Several lines of evidence suggest that epimerization proceeds via enolization of the lactone rather than a previously proposed indirect mechanism. Consistent with the general trend in related compounds, the title compound showed lower affinity at the kappa opioid receptor than the natural epimer salvinorin B (2a). The related 8-epi-acid 4b showed no affinity."
1481,2007,99mTc Hynic-rh-Annexin V scintigraphy for in vivo imaging of apoptosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy,"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to determine the value of 99mTc Hynic-rh-Annexin-V-Scintigraphy (TAVS), a non-invasive in vivo technique to demonstrate apoptosis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.MethodsTAVS were performed before and within 48åÊh after the first course of cisplatin-based chemoradiation. Radiation dose given to the tumour at the time of post-treatment TAVS was 6‰ÛÒ8åÊGy. Single-photon emission tomography data were co-registered to planning CT scan. Complete sets of these data were available for 13 patients. The radiation dose at post-treatment TAVS was calculated for several regions of interest (ROI): primary tumour, involved lymph nodes and salivary glands. Annexin uptake was determined in each ROI, and the difference between post-treatment and baseline TAVS represented the absolute Annexin uptake: Delta uptake (ëÓU).ResultsIn 24 of 26 parotid glands, treatment-induced Annexin uptake was observed. Mean ëÓU was significantly correlated with the mean radiation dose given to the parotid glands (r‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.59, p‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.002): Glands that received higher doses showed more Annexin uptake. ëÓU in primary tumour and pathological lymph nodes showed large inter-patient differences. A high correlation was observed on an inter-patient level (r‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.71, p‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.006) between the maximum ëÓU in primary tumour and in the lymph nodes.ConclusionsWithin the dose range of 0‰ÛÒ8åÊGy, Annexin-V-scintigraphy showed a radiation-dose-dependent uptake in parotid glands, indicative of early apoptosis during treatment. The inter-individual spread in Annexin uptake in primary tumours could not be related to differences in dose or tumour volume, but the Annexin uptake in tumour and lymph nodes were closely correlated. This effect might represent a tumour-specific apoptotic response."

1483,2007,A 100%-complete sequence reveals unusually simple genomic features in the hot-spring red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae,"BackgroundAll previously reported eukaryotic nuclear genome sequences have been incomplete, especially in highly repeated units and chromosomal ends. Because repetitive DNA is important for many aspects of biology, complete chromosomal structures are fundamental for understanding eukaryotic cells. Our earlier, nearly complete genome sequence of the hot-spring red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae revealed several unique features, including just three ribosomal DNA copies, very few introns, and a small total number of genes. However, because the exact structures of certain functionally important repeated elements remained ambiguous, that sequence was not complete. Obviously, those ambiguities needed to be resolved before the unique features of the C. merolae genome could be summarized, and the ambiguities could only be resolved by completing the sequence. Therefore, we aimed to complete all previous gaps and sequence all remaining chromosomal ends, and now report the first nuclear-genome sequence for any eukaryote that is 100% complete.ResultsOur present complete sequence consists of 16546747 nucleotides covering 100% of the 20 linear chromosomes from telomere to telomere, representing the simple and unique chromosomal structures of the eukaryotic cell. We have unambiguously established that the C. merolae genome contains the smallest known histone-gene cluster, a unique telomeric repeat for all chromosomal ends, and an extremely low number of transposons.ConclusionBy virtue of these attributes and others that we had discovered previously, C. merolae appears to have the simplest nuclear genome of the non-symbiotic eukaryotes. These unusually simple genomic features in the 100% complete genome sequence of C. merolae are extremely useful for further studies of eukaryotic cells."

Biopsy samples were positive for M. tuberculosis DNA by PCR, which confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis."
1485,2007,A 1-year case-control study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis indicates prevention of loss of bone mineral density in both responders and nonresponders to infliximab,"The goal of the present study was to record changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of bone turnover in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were treated with methotrexate combined (or not combined) with infliximab. Included were 90 patients with RA who required anti-TNF-ë± therapy with infliximab because of persistent active disease despite treatment with methotrexate. The historical control group included 99 patients with RA who were treated with methotrexate at a time when anti-TNF-ë± treatment was not yet available. Lumbar and femoral neck BMD was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 1 year later. Osteocalcin, C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen, parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol were measured in plasma at baseline and 1 year later. At 1 year BMD had decreased in the control group at spine (P &lt; 0.01) and femoral neck (P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, BMD at spine and femoral neck did not change after 1 year of infliximab treatment. At the same time point, no change in bone remodelling markers was observed. No association was observed between clinical response and changes in BMD, indicating that even those who did not respond clinically did not lose bone over a 1-year period. These data confirm the BMD decrease observed in RA patients treated with methotrexate alone. This bone loss was prevented by infliximab therapy. Importantly, this beneficial effect was also observed in apparent nonresponders."

We describe a case of a previously healthy 57-year-old man developing arthritis while being treated with rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy (R-CHOP) for a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The remittant arthritis developed at successively shorter time-intervals after R-CHOP administration and only improved after rituximab was removed from the chemotherapy schedule, suggesting a rituximab-related phenomenon, as extensive diagnostic testing ruled out any other diagnosis."
1488,2007,A 96-well DNase I footprinting screen for drug‰ÛÒDNA interactions,"The established protocol for DNase I footprinting has been modified to allow multiple parallel reactions to be rapidly performed in 96-well microtitre plates. By scrutinizing every aspect of the traditional method and making appropriate modifications it has been possible to considerably reduce the time, risk of sample loss and complexity of footprinting, whilst dramatically increasing the yield of data (30-fold). A semi-automated analysis system has also been developed to present footprinting data as an estimate of the binding affinity of each tested compound to any base pair in the assessed DNA sequence, giving an intuitive ‰Û÷one compound‰ÛÒone line‰Ûª scheme. Here, we demonstrate the screening capabilities of the 96-well assay and the subsequent data analysis using a series of six pyrrolobenzodiazepine-polypyrrole compounds and human Topoisomerase II alpha promoter DNA. The dramatic increase in throughput, quantified data and decreased handling time allow, for the first time, DNase I footprinting to be used as a screening tool to assess DNA-binding agents."

1490,2007,A BAC end view of the Musa acuminata genome,"BackgroundMusa species contain the fourth most important crop in developing countries. Here, we report the analysis of 6,252 BAC end-sequences, in order to view the sequence composition of the Musa acuminata genome in a cost effective and efficient manner.ResultsBAC end sequencing generated 6,252 reads representing 4,420,944 bp, including 2,979 clone pairs with an average read length after cleaning and filtering of 707 bp. All sequences have been submitted to GenBank, with the accession numbers DX451975 ‰ÛÒ DX458350. The BAC end-sequences, were searched against several databases and significant homology was found to mitochondria and chloroplast (2.6%), transposons and repetitive sequences (36%) and proteins (11%). Functional interpretation of the protein matches was carried out by Gene Ontology assignments from matches to Arabidopsis and was shown to cover a broad range of categories. From protein matching regions of Musa BAC end-sequences, it was determined that the GC content of coding regions was 47%. Where protein matches encompassed a start codon, GC content as a function of position (5' to 3') across 129 bp sliding windows generates a ""rice-like"" gradient. A total of 352 potential SSR markers were discovered. The most abundant simple sequence repeats in four size categories were AT-rich. After filtering mitochondria and chloroplast matches, thousands of BAC end-sequences had a significant BLASTN match to the Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis genome sequence. Of these, a small number of BAC end-sequence pairs were shown to map to neighboring regions of the Oryza sativa genome representing regions of potential microsynteny.ConclusionDatabase searches with the BAC end-sequences and ab initio analysis identified those reads likely to contain transposons, repeat sequences, proteins and simple sequence repeats. Approximately 600 BAC end-sequences contained protein sequences that were not found in the existing available Musa expressed sequence tags, repeat or transposon databases. In addition, gene statistics, GC content and profile could also be estimated based on the region matching the top protein hit. A small number of BAC end pair sequences can be mapped to neighboring regions of the Oryza sativa representing regions of potential microsynteny. These results suggest that a large-scale BAC end sequencing strategy has the potential to anchor a small proportion of the genome of Musa acuminata to the genomes of Oryza sativa and possibly Arabidopsis."
1491,2007,"A BAC pooling strategy combined with PCR-based screenings in a large, highly repetitive genome enables integration of the maize genetic and physical maps","BackgroundMolecular markers serve three important functions in physical map assembly. First, they provide anchor points to genetic maps facilitating functional genomic studies. Second, they reduce the overlap required for BAC contig assembly from 80 to 50 percent. Finally, they validate assemblies based solely on BAC fingerprints. We employed a six-dimensional BAC pooling strategy in combination with a high-throughput PCR-based screening method to anchor the maize genetic and physical maps.ResultsA total of 110,592 maize BAC clones (~ 6x haploid genome equivalents) were pooled into six different matrices, each containing 48 pools of BAC DNA. The quality of the BAC DNA pools and their utility for identifying BACs containing target genomic sequences was tested using 254 PCR-based STS markers. Five types of PCR-based STS markers were screened to assess potential uses for the BAC pools. An average of 4.68 BAC clones were identified per marker analyzed. These results were integrated with BAC fingerprint data generated by the Arizona Genomics Institute (AGI) and the Arizona Genomics Computational Laboratory (AGCoL) to assemble the BAC contigs using the FingerPrinted Contigs (FPC) software and contribute to the construction and anchoring of the physical map. A total of 234 markers (92.5%) anchored BAC contigs to their genetic map positions. The results can be viewed on the integrated map of maize [1,2].ConclusionThis BAC pooling strategy is a rapid, cost effective method for genome assembly and anchoring. The requirement for six replicate positive amplifications makes this a robust method for use in large genomes with high amounts of repetitive DNA such as maize. This strategy can be used to physically map duplicate loci, provide order information for loci in a small genetic interval or with no genetic recombination, and loci with conflicting hybridization-based information."
1492,2007,A Bacterial Kind of Aging,
1493,2007,A Balanced Memory Network,"A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how working memory‰ÛÓthe ability to store information at intermediate timescales, like tens of seconds‰ÛÓis implemented in realistic neuronal networks. The most likely candidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort has gone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quarter century of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In particular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that attractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally during working memory tasks? And second, how many memories can be stored under biologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying an attractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other. Using mean-field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor networks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only if the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean-field analysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network scales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been suggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones. Both of these predictions are verified using simulations with large networks of spiking neurons."
1494,2007,A basic analysis toolkit for biological sequences,"This paper presents a software library, nicknamed BATS, for some basic sequence analysis tasks. Namely, local alignments, via approximate string matching, and global alignments, via longest common subsequence and alignments with affine and concave gap cost functions. Moreover, it also supports filtering operations to select strings from a set and establish their statistical significance, via z-score computation. None of the algorithms is new, but although they are generally regarded as fundamental for sequence analysis, they have not been implemented in a single and consistent software package, as we do here. Therefore, our main contribution is to fill this gap between algorithmic theory and practice by providing an extensible and easy to use software library that includes algorithms for the mentioned string matching and alignment problems. The library consists of C/C++ library functions as well as Perl library functions. It can be interfaced with Bioperl and can also be used as a stand-alone system with a GUI. The software is available at under the GNU GPL."
1495,2007,A Bayesian genome-wide linkage analysis of quantitative traits for rheumatoid arthritis via perfect sampling,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a complex disease caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors, and their additive and/or non-additive effects. We performed a linkage analysis to provide evidence of rheumatoid factor IgM on linkage, based on Bayesian variable selection coupled with the new Haseman-Elston method. For statistical inferences to estimate unknown parameters, we utilized the perfect sampling algorithm, an emerging simulation technique that alleviates concerns over convergence and sampling mixing. Our methods provide powerful and conceptually simple approaches to simultaneous genome scans of main effects and all possible pairwise interactions. We apply them to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 data (Problem 2) provided by the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC)."
1496,2007,A Bayesian latent class analysis for whole-genome association analyses: an illustration using the GAW15 simulated rheumatoid arthritis dense scan data,"Although rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and inflammatory disease affecting numerous adults, has a complex genetic component involving the human leukocyte antigen region, additional genomic regions most likely affects susceptibility. Whole-genome scans may assist in identifying these additional candidate regions, but a large number of false-positives are likely to occur using traditional statistical methods. Therefore, novel statistical approaches are needed. Here, we used a single replicate from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 simulated data to assess for marker-disease associations in 1500 rheumatoid arthritis cases and 2000 controls on chromosome 6. The statistical methods included a maximum-likelihood estimation approach and a novel Bayesian latent class analysis. The Bayesian analysis ""borrows strength"" from multiple loci to estimate association parameters and can incorporate differences across loci in the prior probability of association. Because of this, we hypothesized that the Bayesian analysis might be better able to detect true associations while minimizing false positives. The Bayesian posterior means for the log alleleic odds ratios were less variable than the maximum likelihood estimates, but the posterior probabilities were not as good as the simple p-values in distinguishing a signal from a non-signal. Overall, Bayesian latent class analyses provided no obvious improvement over maximum-likelihood estimation. However, our results may not be able to be generalized due to the large effect simulated in the human leukocyte antigen-DR locus."
1497,2007,A Bayesian nonparametric method for prediction in EST analysis,"BackgroundExpressed sequence tags (ESTs) analyses are a fundamental tool for gene identification in organisms. Given a preliminary EST sample from a certain library, several statistical prediction problems arise. In particular, it is of interest to estimate how many new genes can be detected in a future EST sample of given size and also to determine the gene discovery rate: these estimates represent the basis for deciding whether to proceed sequencing the library and, in case of a positive decision, a guideline for selecting the size of the new sample. Such information is also useful for establishing sequencing efficiency in experimental design and for measuring the degree of redundancy of an EST library.ResultsIn this work we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach for tackling statistical problems related to EST surveys. In particular, we provide estimates for: a) the coverage, defined as the proportion of unique genes in the library represented in the given sample of reads; b) the number of new unique genes to be observed in a future sample; c) the discovery rate of new genes as a function of the future sample size. The Bayesian nonparametric model we adopt conveys, in a statistically rigorous way, the available information into prediction. Our proposal has appealing properties over frequentist nonparametric methods, which become unstable when prediction is required for large future samples. EST libraries, previously studied with frequentist methods, are analyzed in detail.ConclusionThe Bayesian nonparametric approach we undertake yields valuable tools for gene capture and prediction in EST libraries. The estimators we obtain do not feature the kind of drawbacks associated with frequentist estimators and are reliable for any size of the additional sample."
1498,2007,A Bayesian Perceptual Model Replicates the Cutaneous Rabbit and Other Tactile Spatiotemporal Illusions,"BackgroundWhen brief stimuli contact the skin in rapid succession at two or more locations, perception strikingly shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time, between consecutive events. The origins of these perceptual space-time distortions are unknown.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere I show that these illusory effects, which I term perceptual length contraction and time dilation, are emergent properties of a Bayesian observer model that incorporates prior expectation for speed. Rapidly moving stimuli violate expectation, provoking perceptual length contraction and time dilation. The Bayesian observer replicates the cutaneous rabbit illusion, the tau effect, the kappa effect, and other spatiotemporal illusions. Additionally, it shows realistic tactile temporal order judgment and spatial attention effects.Conclusions/SignificanceThe remarkable explanatory power of this simple model supports the hypothesis, first proposed by Helmholtz, that the brain biases perception in favor of expectation. Specifically, the results suggest that the brain automatically incorporates prior expectation for speed in order to overcome spatial and temporal imprecision inherent in the sensorineural signal."
1499,2007,"ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI: hormonal regulation in primary rat hepatocytes and human cell lines","BackgroundScavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI), ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) -and G1 (ABCG1) all play important roles in the reverse cholesterol transport. Reverse cholesterol transport is a mechanism whereby the body can eliminate excess cholesterol. Here, the regulation of SR-BI, ABCA1, and ABCG1 by dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) and insulin were studied in order to gain more insight into the role of these two hormones in the cholesterol metabolism.ResultsBy use of real time RT-PCR and Western blotting we examined the expression of our target genes. The results show that SR-BI, ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression increased in response to dexamethasone while insulin treatment reduced the expression in primary rat hepatocytes. The stimulatory effect of dexamethasone was reduced by the addition of the anti-glucocorticoid mifepristone. In HepG2 cells and THP-1 macrophages, however, the effect of dexamethasone was absent or inhibitory with no significant change in the presence of mifepristone. The latter observation may be a result of the low protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in these cell lines.ConclusionOur results illustrates that insulin and glucocorticoids, two hormones crucial in the carbohydrate metabolism, also play an important role in the regulation of genes central in reverse cholesterol transport. We found a marked difference in mRNA expression between the primary cells and the two established cell lines when studying the effect of dexamethasone which may result from the varying expression levels of GR."
1500,2007,Abdominal Irradiation Ameliorates Obesity in ob/ob Mice,"Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are a murine model for obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Here we report that non-lethal abdominal irradiation (a single fraction of 850 cGy) to ob/ob mice retarded rapid gain of body weight, leading to amelioration of obesity without marked changes in food intake. This effect was observed only in ob/ob mice and not in lean controls. Reduction of body weight was accompanied by decreased adipose tissue weight without any marked change in the size of adipocytes, indicating prevention of hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy. Gene expression of the radiation-inducible cdk-inhibitor, p21, and the adipocytokines, tumor necrosis factor ë± and interleukin-1ë_, were induced as expected; but genes involved in adipogenesis such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ë_ and adipsin were not affected in the irradiated adipose tissue. Inversely, hepatic lipid content was elevated with concomitant increases in the expression of lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c. Despite the decreased adiposity, there was no improvement in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia after the irradiation. In conclusion, abdominal irradiation to ob/ob mice affected the progression of obesity and altered the energy metabolism between organs through a novel mechanism, implicating a new approach or factor for understanding and treatment of obesity."

1502,2008,[11C]CHIBA-1001 as a Novel PET Ligand for ë±7 Nicotinic Receptors in the Brain: A PET Study in Conscious Monkeys,"BackgroundThe ë±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. However, there are currently no suitable positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for imaging ë±7 nAChRs in the intact human brain. Here we report the novel PET radioligand [11C]CHIBA-1001 for in vivo imaging of ë±7 nAChRs in the non-human primate brain.Methodology/Principal FindingsA receptor binding assay showed that CHIBA-1001 was a highly selective ligand at ë±7 nAChRs. Using conscious monkeys, we found that the distribution of radioactivity in the monkey brain after intravenous administration of [11C]CHIBA-1001 was consistent with the regional distribution of ë±7 nAChRs in the monkey brain. The distribution of radioactivity in the brain regions after intravenous administration of [11C]CHIBA-1001 was blocked by pretreatment with the selective ë±7 nAChR agonist SSR180711 (5.0 mg/kg). However, the distribution of [11C]CHIBA-1001 was not altered by pretreatment with the selective ë±4ë_2 nAChR agonist A85380 (1.0 mg/kg). Interestingly, the binding of [11C]CHIBA-1001 in the frontal cortex of the monkey brain was significantly decreased by subchronic administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist phencyclidine (0.3 mg/kg, twice a day for 13 days); which is a non-human primate model of schizophrenia.Conclusions/SignificanceThe present findings suggest that [11C]CHIBA-1001 could be a novel useful PET ligand for in vivo study of the receptor occupancy and pathophysiology of ë±7 nAChRs in the intact brain of patients with neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease."
1503,2008,"1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) disrupts the estrogen-androgen balance regulating the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells","IntroductionEstrogen and androgen signalling pathways exert opposing influences on the proliferation of mammary epithelial and hormone-dependent breast cancer cells. We previously reported that plasma concentrations of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), the main metabolite of the insecticide DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis [p-chlorophenyl]ethane) and a potent androgen antagonist, were associated with tumor aggressiveness in women diagnosed with breast cancer. We sought to examine the biological plausibility of this association by testing the effect of p,p'-DDE on the proliferation of CAMA-1 cells, a human breast cancer cell line that expresses the estrogen receptor alpha (ERë±) and the androgen receptor (AR), in the presence of physiological concentrations of estrogens and androgens in the cell culture medium.MethodsThe proliferation of CAMA-1 cells was determined in 96-well plates following a 9-day treatment with p,p'-DDE alone (0.1 to 10 ë_M) or in combination with 17ë_-estradiol (E2) (100 pM) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (100, 500, or 1,000 pM). We also assessed p,p'-DDE-induced modifications in cell cycle entry and the expression of the sex-steroid-dependent genes ESR1, AR, CCND1, and TFF1 (pS2) (mRNA and/or protein).ResultsWe found that treatment with p,p'-DDE induced a dose-response increase in the proliferation of CAMA-1 cells when cultivated in the presence of physiological concentrations of estrogens and androgens, but not in the absence of sex steroids in the cell culture medium. A similar effect of p,p'-DDE was noted on the proliferation of MCF7-AR1 cells, an estrogen-responsive cell line that was genetically engineered to overexpress the AR. DHT added together with E2 to the cell culture medium decreased the recruitment of CAMA-1 cells in the S phase and the expression of ESR1 and CCND1 by comparison with cells treated with E2 alone. These androgen-mediated effects were blocked with similar efficacy by p,p'-DDE and the potent antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide.ConclusionOur results suggest that p,p'-DDE could increase breast cancer progression by opposing the androgen signalling pathway that inhibits growth in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells. The potential role of environmental antiandrogens in breast carcinogenesis deserves further investigation."
1504,2008,"13,915 reasons for equity in sexual offences legislation: A national school-based survey in South Africa","ObjectivePrior to 2007, forced sex with male children in South Africa did not count as rape but as ""indecent assault"", a much less serious offence. This study sought to document prevalence of male sexual violence among school-going youth.DesignA facilitated self-administered questionnaire in nine of the 11 official languages in a stratified (province/metro/urban/rural) last stage random national sample.SettingTeams visited 5162 classes in 1191 schools, in October and November 2002.ParticipantsA total of 269,705 learners aged 10‰ÛÒ19 years in grades 6‰ÛÒ11. Of these, 126,696 were male.Main outcome measuresSchoolchildren answered questions about exposure in the last year to insults, beating, unwanted touching and forced sex. They indicated the sex of the perpetrator, and whether this was a family member, a fellow schoolchild, a teacher or another adult. Respondents also gave the age when they first suffered forced sex and when they first had consensual sex.ResultsSome 9% (weighted value based on 13915/127097) of male respondents aged 11‰ÛÒ19 years reported forced sex in the last year. Of those aged 18 years at the time of the survey, 44% (weighted value of 5385/11450) said they had been forced to have sex in their lives and 50% reported consensual sex. Perpetrators were most frequently an adult not from their own family, followed closely in frequency by other schoolchildren. Some 32% said the perpetrator was male, 41% said she was female and 27% said they had been forced to have sex by both male and female perpetrators. Male abuse of schoolboys was more common in rural areas while female perpetration was more an urban phenomenon.ConclusionThis study uncovers endemic sexual abuse of male children that was suspected but hitherto only poorly documented. Legal recognition of the criminality of rape of male children is a first step. The next steps include serious investment in supporting male victims of abuse, and in prevention of all childhood sexual abuse."
1505,2008,13C labeling experiments at metabolic nonstationary conditions: An exploratory study,"BackgroundStimulus Response Experiments to unravel the regulatory properties of metabolic networks are becoming more and more popular. However, their ability to determine enzyme kinetic parameters has proven to be limited with the presently available data. In metabolic flux analysis, the use of 13C labeled substrates together with isotopomer modeling solved the problem of underdetermined networks and increased the accuracy of flux estimations significantly.ResultsIn this contribution, the idea of increasing the information content of the dynamic experiment by adding 13C labeling is analyzed. For this purpose a small example network is studied by simulation and statistical methods. Different scenarios regarding available measurements are analyzed and compared to a non-labeled reference experiment. Sensitivity analysis revealed a specific influence of the kinetic parameters on the labeling measurements. Statistical methods based on parameter sensitivities and different measurement models are applied to assess the information gain of the labeled stimulus response experiment.ConclusionIt was found that the use of a (specifically) labeled substrate will significantly increase the parameter estimation accuracy. An overall information gain of about a factor of six is observed for the example network. The information gain is achieved from the specific influence of the kinetic parameters towards the labeling measurements. This also leads to a significant decrease in correlation of the kinetic parameters compared to an experiment without 13C-labeled substrate."
1506,2008,14-3-3 activation of DNA binding of p53 by enhancing its association into tetramers,"Activation of the tumour suppressor p53 on DNA damage involves post-translational modification by phosphorylation and acetylation. Phosphorylation of certain residues is critical for p53 stabilization and plays an important role in DNA-binding activity. The 14-3-3 family of proteins activates the DNA-binding affinity of p53 upon stress by binding to a site in its intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain containing a phosphorylated serine at 378. We have screened various p53 C-terminal phosphorylated peptides for binding to two different isoforms of 14-3-3, ƒÝ and ë_. We found that phosphorylation at either S366 or T387 caused even tighter binding to 14-3-3. We made by semi-synthesis a tetrameric construct comprised of the tetramerization plus C-terminal domains of p53 that was phosphorylated on S366, S378 and T387. It bound 10 times tighter than did the monomeric counterpart to dimeric 14-3-3. We showed indirectly from binding curves and directly from fluorescence-detection analytical ultracentrifugation that 14-3-3 enhanced the binding of sequence-specific DNA to p53 by causing p53 dimers to form tetramers at lower concentrations. If the in vitro data extrapolate to in vivo, then it is an attractive hypothesis that p53 activity may be subject to control by accessory proteins lowering its tetramer‰ÛÒdimer dissociation constant from its normal value of 120‰ÛÒ150 nM."
1507,2008,14-3-3 theta binding to cell cycle regulatory factors is enhanced by HIV-1 Vpr,"BackgroundDespite continuing advances in our understanding of AIDS pathogenesis, the mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals remains unclear. The HIV-1 Vpr accessory protein causes cell death, likely through a mechanism related to its ability to arrest cells in the G2,M phase. Recent evidence implicated the scaffold protein, 14-3-3, in Vpr cell cycle blockade.ResultsWe found that in human T cells, 14-3-3 plays an active role in mediating Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest and reveal a dramatic increase in the amount of Cdk1, Cdc25C, and CyclinB1 bound to 14-3-3 ëü during Vprv-induced G2,M arrest. By contrast, a cell-cycle-arrest-dead Vpr mutant failed to augment 14-3-3 ëü association with Cdk1 and CyclinB1. Moreover, G2,M arrest caused by HIV-1 infection strongly correlated with a disruption in 14-3-3 ëü binding to centrosomal proteins, Plk1 and centrin. Finally, Vpr caused elevated levels of CyclinB1, Plk1, and Cdk1 in a complex with the nuclear transport and spindle assembly protein, importin ë_.ConclusionThus, our data reveal a new facet of Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest involving previously unrecognized abnormal rearrangements of multiprotein assemblies containing key cell cycle regulatory proteins.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by David Kaplan, Nathaniel R.

1508,2008,"15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 attenuates endothelial-monocyte interaction: implication for inflammatory diseases","BackgroundThe Infiltration of leukocytes across the brain endothelium is a hallmark of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Under inflammatory conditions, there is increased expression of specific cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on activated vascular endothelial cells which increases the adhesion and infiltration of leukocytes. TNFë± is one of the major proinflammatory cytokines that causes endothelial dysfunction by various mechanisms including activation of transcription factor NF-ë¼B, a key transcription factor that regulates expression of CAMs. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARë_) is a member of the nuclear hormone superfamily of ligand-activated transcriptional factors. 15-deoxy-ë« 12, 14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) is a well recognized natural ligand of PPARë_ and possesses anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of 15-PGJ2 on the adhesion of mononuclear cells to activated endothelial cells.MethodsTo delineate the signaling pathway of 15d-PGJ2 mediated effects, we employed an in vitro adhesion assay model of endothelial-monocyte interaction. Expression of CAMs was examined using flow cytometry and real time PCR techniques. To define the mechanism of 15d-PGJ2, we explored the role of NF-ë¼B by EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay) gels, NF-ë¼B reporter and p65-transcriptional activities by transient transfection in the brain-derived endothelial cell line (bEND.3).ResultsUsing an in vitro adhesion assay model, we demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits TNFë± induced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, which is mediated by downregulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules in a PPARë_ independent manner. 15d-PGJ2 modulated the adhesion process by inhibiting the TNFë± induced IKK-NF-ë¼B pathway as evident from EMSA, NF-ë¼B reporter and p65 mediated transcriptional activity results in bEND.3 cells.ConclusionThese findings suggest that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits inflammation at multiple steps and thus is a potential therapeutic target for various inflammatory diseases."
1509,2008,18-Month Effectiveness of Short-Course Antiretroviral Regimens Combined with Alternatives to Breastfeeding to Prevent HIV Mother-to-Child Transmission,"ObjectiveWe assessed the 18-month effectiveness of short-course (sc) antiretroviral peripartum regimens combined with alternatives to prolonged breastfeeding to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 in Abidjan, CÌ«te d'Ivoire.MethodologyHIV-1 infected pregnant women received from ‰ä´32‰ÛÒ36 weeks of gestation scZidovudine (ZDV)+/‰öÕLamivudine (3TC)+single-dose Nevirapine (sdNVP) at delivery within the ANRS 1201/1202 DITRAME-Plus cohort (2001‰ÛÒ2003). Neonates received a sdNVP+7-day ZDV prophylaxis. Two infant-feeding interventions were systematically offered free of charge: formula-feeding or exclusive shortened breastfeeding with early cessation from four months. The reference group was the ANRS 049a DITRAME cohort (1994‰ÛÒ2000) exposed to scZDV from 36 weeks, then to prolonged breastfeeding. Pediatric HIV infection was defined by a positive plasma HIV-1 RNA at any age, or if aged ‰ä´18 months, a positive HIV-1 serology. Turnbull estimates of cumulative transmission risks (CTR) and effectiveness (HIV-free survival) were compared by exposure group using a Cox model.FindingsAmong 926 live-born children enrolled, 107 (11.6%) were HIV-infected at 18 months. CTRs were 22.3% (95% confidence interval[CI]:16‰ÛÒ30%) in the 238 ZDV long-term breastfed reference group, 15.9% (CI:10‰ÛÒ27%) in the 169 ZDV+sdNVP shortened breastfed group; 9.4% (CI:6‰ÛÒ14%) in the 195 ZDV+sdNVP formula-fed group; 6.8% (CI:4‰ÛÒ11%) in the 198 ZDV+3TC+sdNVP shortened breastfed group, and 5.6% (CI:2‰ÛÒ10%) in the 126 ZDV+3TC+sdNVP formula-fed group. Each combination had a significantly higher effectiveness than the ZDV long-term breastfed group except for ZDV+sdNVP shortened breastfed children, ranging from 51% (CI:20‰ÛÒ70%) for ZDV+sdNVP formula fed children to 63% (CI:40‰ÛÒ80%) for ZDV+3TC+NVPsd shortened breastfed children, after adjustment for maternal eligibility for antiretroviral therapy (ART), home delivery and low birth-weight. Substantial MTCT risk reductions are reachable in Africa, even in short-term breastfed children. The two sc antiretroviral combinations associated to any of the two infant feeding interventions, formula-feeding and shortened breastfeeding, reduce significantly MTCT with long-term benefit until age 18 months and without increasing mortality."
1510,2008,"18-month occurrence of severe events among early diagnosed HIV-infected children before antiretroviral therapy in Abidjan, CÌ«te d'Ivoire: A cohort study","ObjectiveTo assess the 18-month field effectiveness on severe events of a pediatric package combining early HIV-diagnosis and targeted cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children from age six-week before the antiretroviral era, in Abidjan, CÌ«te d'Ivoire.MethodsData from two consecutive prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission programs were compared: the ANRS 1201/1202 Ditrame-Plus cohort (2001‰ÛÒ2005) and the pooled data of the ANRS 049a Ditrame randomized trial and its following open-labeled cohort (1995‰ÛÒ2000), used as a reference group. HIV-infected pregnant women ‰ä´ 32‰ÛÒ36 weeks of gestation were offered a short-course peri-partum antiretroviral prophylaxis (ZDV in Ditrame, and ZDV å± 3TC+single-dose (sd) NVP in Ditrame-Plus). Neonatal prophylaxis was provided in Ditrame-Plus only: 7-day ZDV and sdNVP 48‰ÛÒ72 h after birth. A 6-week pediatric HIV-RNA diagnosis was provided on-line in the Ditrame-Plus while it was only oriented on clinical symptoms in Ditrame. Six-week HIV-infected children received a daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in Ditrame-Plus while no prophylaxis was provided in Ditrame. The determinants of severe events (death or hospitalization &gt; 1 day) were assessed in a Cox regression model.ResultsBetween 1995 and 2003, 98 out of the 1121 live-births were diagnosed as HIV-infected in peri-partum: 45 from Ditrame-Plus and 53 from Ditrame. The 18-month Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of presenting a severe event was 66% in Ditrame-Plus (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 50%‰ÛÒ81%) and 77% in Ditrame (95%CI: 65%‰ÛÒ89%), Log Rank test: p = 0.47. After adjustment on maternal WHO clinical stage, maternal death, 6-week pediatric viral load, birth-weight, and breastfeeding exposure, the 18-month risk of severe event was lower in Ditrame-Plus than in Ditrame (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 0.55, 95%CI: 0.3‰ÛÒ1.1), although the difference was not statistically significant; p = 0.07). Maternal death was the only variable determinant of the occurrence of severe events in children (aHR: 3.73; CI: 2.2‰ÛÒ11.2; p = 0.01).ConclusionEarly cotrimoxazole from 6 weeks of age in HIV-infected infants seemed to reduce probability of severe events but the study lacked statistical power to prove this. Even with systematic cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, infant morbidity and mortality remained high pointing towards a need for early pediatric HIV-diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment in Africa."
1511,2008,1H NMR metabonomics approach to the disease continuum of diabetic complications and premature death,"Subtle metabolic changes precede and accompany chronic vascular complications, which are the primary causes of premature death in diabetes. To obtain a multimetabolite characterization of these high-risk individuals, we measured proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) data from the serum of 613 patients with type I diabetes and a diverse spread of complications. We developed a new metabonomics framework to visualize and interpret the data and to link the metabolic profiles to the underlying diagnostic and biochemical variables. Our results indicate complex interactions between diabetic kidney disease, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. We illustrate how a single 1H NMR protocol is able to identify the polydiagnostic metabolite manifold of type I diabetes and how its alterations translate to clinical phenotypes, clustering of micro- and macrovascular complications, and mortality during several years of follow-up. This work demonstrates the diffuse nature of complex vascular diseases and the limitations of single diagnostic biomarkers. However, it also promises cost-effective solutions through high-throughput analytics and advanced computational methods, as applied here in a case that is representative of the real clinical situation."

1513,2008,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin Exposure Prevents Cardiac Valve Formation in Developing Zebrafish","Cardiovascular malformations are one of the most common congenital birth defects observed in humans. Defects in cardiac valves disrupt normal blood flow. Zebrafish are an outstanding experimental model for studying the effects that environmental contaminants have on developmental processes. Previous research has shown that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) causes blood regurgitation in the heart and reduces peripheral blood flow in embryonic zebrafish, suggesting some form of valve failure. To test this we used video microscopy to examine valve function and structure in developing zebrafish exposed to TCDD. TCDD exposure produced blood regurgitation at both the atrioventricular (AV) and bulboventricular (BV) junctions. In marked contrast to control embryos exposed to the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide, embryos exposed to TCDD failed to form valve leaflets as the heart matured. In addition, whereas TCDD did not block initial formation of the bulbus arteriosus, we found that TCDD exposure prevented the normal growth and development of this portion of the outflow tract. TCDD altered the localization of endothelial cells at the AV and BV junctions and altered the localized expression of mRNAs bmp4 and notch1b normally associated with the nascent valves. Taken together, our results demonstrate that although TCDD does not prevent the initial specification of the presumptive valve locations, TCDD exposure produces severe alterations in valve development, leading to blood regurgitation and failing circulation in the developing zebrafish."
1514,2008,2‰Û_-Methylseleno-modified oligoribonucleotides for X-ray crystallography synthesized by the ACE RNA solid-phase approach,"Site-specifically modified 2‰Û_-methylseleno RNA represents a valuable derivative for phasing of X-ray crystallographic data. Several successful applications in three-dimensional structure determination of nucleic acids, such as the Diels‰ÛÒAlder ribozyme, have relied on this modification. Here, we introduce synthetic routes to 2‰Û_-methylseleno phosphoramidite building blocks of all four standard nucleosides, adenosine, cytidine, guanosine and uridine, that are tailored for 2‰Û_-O-bis(acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE) RNA solid-phase synthesis. We additionally report on their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides including deprotection and purification. The methodological expansion of 2‰Û_-methylseleno labeling via ACE RNA chemistry is a major step to make Se-RNA generally accessible and to receive broad dissemination of the Se-approach for crystallographic studies on RNA. Thus far, preparation of 2‰Û_-methylseleno-modified oligoribonucleotides has been restricted to the 2‰Û_-O-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (TOM) and 2‰Û_-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) RNA synthesis methods."
1515,2008,"2DB: a Proteomics database for storage, analysis, presentation, and retrieval of information from mass spectrometric experiments","BackgroundThe amount of information stemming from proteomics experiments involving (multi dimensional) separation techniques, mass spectrometric analysis, and computational analysis is ever-increasing. Data from such an experimental workflow needs to be captured, related and analyzed. Biological experiments within this scope produce heterogenic data ranging from pictures of one or two-dimensional protein maps and spectra recorded by tandem mass spectrometry to text-based identifications made by algorithms which analyze these spectra. Additionally, peptide and corresponding protein information needs to be displayed.ResultsIn order to handle the large amount of data from computational processing of mass spectrometric experiments, automatic import scripts are available and the necessity for manual input to the database has been minimized. Information is in a generic format which abstracts from specific software tools typically used in such an experimental workflow. The software is therefore capable of storing and cross analysing results from many algorithms. A novel feature and a focus of this database is to facilitate protein identification by using peptides identified from mass spectrometry and link this information directly to respective protein maps. Additionally, our application employs spectral counting for quantitative presentation of the data. All information can be linked to hot spots on images to place the results into an experimental context. A summary of identified proteins, containing all relevant information per hot spot, is automatically generated, usually upon either a change in the underlying protein models or due to newly imported identifications. The supporting information for this report can be accessed in multiple ways using the user interface provided by the application.ConclusionWe present a proteomics database which aims to greatly reduce evaluation time of results from mass spectrometric experiments and enhance result quality by allowing consistent data handling. Import functionality, automatic protein detection, and summary creation act together to facilitate data analysis. In addition, supporting information for these findings is readily accessible via the graphical user interface provided. The database schema and the implementation, which can easily be installed on virtually any server, can be downloaded in the form of a compressed file from our project webpage."
1516,2008,2-Deoxy-2[F-18]FDG-PET for Detection of Recurrent Laryngeal Carcinoma after Radiotherapy: Interobserver Variability in Reporting,"PurposeTo evaluate accuracy and interobserver variability in the assessment of 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-d-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for detection of recurrent laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy.ProceduresEleven experienced nuclear physicians from eight centres assessed 30 FDG-PET scans on the appearance of local recurrence (negative/equivocal/positive). Conservative (equivocal analysed as negative) and sensitive (equivocal analysed as positive) assessment strategies were compared to the reference standard (recurrence within 6months after PET).ResultsSeven patients had proven recurrences. For the conservative and sensitive strategy, the mean sensitivity was 87% and 97%, specificity 81% and 63%, positive predictive values 61% and 46% and negative predictive values 96% and 99%, respectively. Interobserver variability showed a reasonable relation in comparison to the reference standard (kappa = 0.55).ConclusionsFDG-PET has acceptable interobserver agreement and yields good negative predictive value for detection of recurrent laryngeal carcinoma. It could therefore be used as first diagnostic step and may reduce futile invasive diagnostics."
1517,2008,2S Albumin Storage Proteins: What Makes them Food Allergens?,"2S albumin storage proteins are becoming of increasing interest in nutritional and clinical studies as they have been reported as major food allergens in seeds of many mono- and di-cotyledonous plants. This review describes the main biochemical, structural and functional properties of these proteins thought to play a role in determining their potential allergenicity. 2S albumins are considered to sensitize directly via the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The high stability of their intrinsic protein structure, dominated by a well-conserved skeleton of cysteine residues, to the harsh conditions present in the GIT suggests that these proteins are able to cross the gut mucosal barrier to sensitize the mucosal immune system and/or elicit an allergic response. The flexible and solvent-exposed hypervariable region of these proteins is immunodominant and has the ability to bind IgE from allergic patientså« sera. Several linear IgE-binding epitopes of 2S albumins spanning this region have been described to play a major role in allergenicity; the role of conformational epitopes of these proteins in food allergy is far from being understood and need to be investigated. Finally, the interaction of these proteins with other components of the food matrix might influence the absorption rates of immunologically reactive 2S albumins but also in their immune response."

1519,2008,3D-Fun: predicting enzyme function from structure,"The ‰Û÷omics‰Ûª revolution is causing a flurry of data that all needs to be annotated for it to become useful. Sequences of proteins of unknown function can be annotated with a putative function by comparing them with proteins of known function. This form of annotation is typically performed with BLAST or similar software. Structural genomics is nowadays also bringing us three dimensional structures of proteins with unknown function. We present here software that can be used when sequence comparisons fail to determine the function of a protein with known structure but unknown function. The software, called 3D-Fun, is implemented as a server that runs at several European institutes and is freely available for everybody at all these sites. The 3D-Fun servers accept protein coordinates in the standard PDB format and compare them with all known protein structures by 3D structural superposition using the 3D-Hit software. If structural hits are found with proteins with known function, these are listed together with their function and some vital comparison statistics. This is conceptually very similar in 3D to what BLAST does in 1D. Additionally, the superposition results are displayed using interactive graphics facilities. Currently, the 3D-Fun system only predicts enzyme function but an expanded version with Gene Ontology predictions will be available soon. The server can be accessed at http://3dfun.bioinfo.pl/ or at http://3dfun.cmbi.ru.nl/."
1520,2008,3D representation of Wnt and Frizzled gene expression patterns in the mouse embryo at embryonic day 11.5 (Ts19),"AbstractWnt signalling is one of the fundamental cell communication systems operating in the embryo and the collection of 19 Wnt and 10 Frizzled (Fzd) receptor genes (in mouse and human) represent just part of a complex system to be unravelled. Here we present a spatially comprehensive set of data on the 3D distribution of Wnt and Fzd gene expression patterns at a carefully selected single stage of mouse development. Overviews and selected features of the patterns are presented and the full 3D data set, generated by fully described probes, is available to the research community through the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas of Gene Expression. In addition to being comprehensive, the data set has been generated and recorded in a consistent manner to facilitate comparisons between gene expression patterns with the capacity to generate matching virtual sections from the 3D representations for specific studies. Expression patterns in the left forelimb were selected for more detailed comparative description. In addition to confirming the previously published expression of these genes, our whole embryo and limb bud analyses significantly extend the data in terms of details of the patterns and the addition of previously undetected sites of expression. Our focussed analysis of expression domains in the limb, defined by just two gene families, reveals a surprisingly high degree of spatial complexity and underlines the enormous potential for local cellular interactions that exist within an emerging structure. This work also highlights the use of OPT to generate detailed high-quality, spatially complex expression data that is readily comparable between specimens and can be reviewed and reanalysed as required for specific studies. It represents a core set of data that will be extended with additional stages of development and through addition of potentially interacting genes and ultimately other cross-regulatory communication pathways operating in the embryo."
1521,2008,3D visualization software to analyze topological outcomes of topoisomerase reactions,"The action of various DNA topoisomerases frequently results in characteristic changes in DNA topology. Important information for understanding mechanistic details of action of these topoisomerases can be provided by investigating the knot types resulting from topoisomerase action on circular DNA forming a particular knot type. Depending on the topological bias of a given topoisomerase reaction, one observes different subsets of knotted products. To establish the character of topological bias, one needs to be aware of all possible topological outcomes of intersegmental passages occurring within a given knot type. However, it is not trivial to systematically enumerate topological outcomes of strand passage from a given knot type. We present here a 3D visualization software (TopoICE-X in KnotPlot) that incorporates topological analysis methods in order to visualize, for example, knots that can be obtained from a given knot by one intersegmental passage. The software has several other options for the topological analysis of mechanisms of action of various topoisomerases."

The method proposed in this paper is a fully automatic 3D blockwise version of the nonlocal (NL) means filter with wavelet subbands mixing. The proposed wavelet subbands mixing is based on a multiresolution approach for improving the quality of image denoising filter. Quantitative validation was carried out on synthetic datasets generated with the BrainWeb simulator. The results show that our NL-means filter with wavelet subbands mixing outperforms the classical implementation of the NL-means filter in terms of denoising quality and computation time. Comparison with wellestablished methods, such as nonlinear diffusion filter and total variation minimization, shows that the proposed NL-means filter produces better denoising results. Finally, qualitative results on real data are presented."

1525,2008,45S rDNA Regions Are Chromosome Fragile Sites Expressed as Gaps In Vitro on Metaphase Chromosomes of Root-Tip Meristematic Cells in Lolium spp,"BackgroundIn humans, chromosome fragile sites are regions that are especially prone to forming non-staining gaps, constrictions or breaks in one or both of the chromatids on metaphase chromosomes either spontaneously or following partial inhibition of DNA synthesis and have been well identified. So far, no plant chromosome fragile sites similar to those in human chromosomes have been reported.Methods and ResultsDuring the course of cytological mapping of rDNA on ryegrass chromosomes, we found that the number of chromosomes plus chromosome fragments was often more than the expected 14 in most cells for Lolium perenne L. cv. Player by close cytological examination using a routine chromosome preparation procedure. Further fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using 45S rDNA as a probe indicated that the root-tip cells having more than a 14-chromosome plus chromosome fragment count were a result of chromosome breakage or gap formation in vitro (referred to as chromosome lesions) at 45S rDNA sites, and 86% of the cells exhibited chromosome breaks or gaps and all occurred at the sites of 45S rDNA in Lolium perenne L. cv. Player, as well as in L. multiflorum Lam. cv. Top One. Chromatin depletion or decondensation occurred at various locations within the 45S rDNA regions, suggesting heterogeneity of lesions of 45S rDNA sites with respect to their position within the rDNA region.ConclusionsThe chromosome lesions observed in this study are very similar cytologically to that of fragile sites observed in human chromosomes, and thus we conclude that the high frequency of chromosome lesions in vitro in Lolium species is the result of the expression of 45S rDNA fragile sites. Possible causes for the spontaneous expression of fragile sites and their potential biological significance are discussed."
1526,2008,4DXpress: a database for cross-species expression pattern comparisons,"In the major animal model species like mouse, fish or fly, detailed spatial information on gene expression over time can be acquired through whole mount in situ hybridization experiments. In these species, expression patterns of many genes have been studied and data has been integrated into dedicated model organism databases like ZFIN for zebrafish, MEPD for medaka, BDGP for Drosophila or GXD for mouse. However, a central repository that allows users to query and compare gene expression patterns across different species has not yet been established. Therefore, we have integrated expression patterns for zebrafish, Drosophila, medaka and mouse into a central public repository called 4DXpress (expression database in four dimensions). Users can query anatomy ontology-based expression annotations across species and quickly jump from one gene to the orthologues in other species. Genes are linked to public microarray data in ArrayExpress. We have mapped developmental stages between the species to be able to compare developmental time phases. We store the largest collection of gene expression patterns available to date in an individual resource, reflecting 16 505 annotated genes. 4DXpress will be an invaluable tool for developmental as well as for computational biologists interested in gene regulation and evolution. 4DXpress is available at http://ani.embl.de/4DXpress."
1527,2008,5‰Û_HS5 of the Human ë_-globin Locus Control Region Is Dispensable for the Formation of the ë_-globin Active Chromatin Hub,"Hypersensitive site 5 (5‰Û_HS5) of the ë_-globin Locus Control Region functions as a developmental stage-specific border in erythroid cells. Here, we have analyzed the role of 5‰Û_HS5 in the three dimensional organization of the ë_-gene locus using the Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) technique. The results show that when 5‰Û_HS5 is deleted from the locus, both remote and internal regulatory elements are still able to interact with each other in a three-dimensional configuration termed the Active Chromatin Hub. Thus, the absence of 5‰Û_HS5 does not have an appreciable effect on the three dimensional organization of the ë_-globin locus. This rules out models in which 5‰Û_HS5 nucleates interactions with remote and/or internal regulatory elements. We also determined the binding of CTCF, the only defined insulator protein in mammalian cells, to 5‰Û_HS5 by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We detect low levels of CTCF binding to 5‰Û_HS5 in primitive erythroid cells, in which it functions as a border element. Surprisingly, we also observe binding levels of CTCF to 5‰Û_HS5 in definitive erythroid cells. Thus, binding of CTCF to 5‰Û_HS5 per se does not render it a functional border element. This is consistent with the previous data suggesting that CTCF has dual functionality."
1528,2008,60S ribosomal subunit assembly dynamics defined by semi-quantitative mass spectrometry of purified complexes,"During the highly conserved process of eukaryotic ribosome formation, RNA follows a maturation path with well-defined, successive intermediates that dynamically associate with many pre-ribosomal proteins. A comprehensive description of the assembly process is still lacking. To obtain data on the timing and order of association of the different pre-ribosomal factors, a strategy consists in the use of pre-ribsomal particles isolated from mutants that block ribosome formation at different steps. Immunoblots, inherently limited to only a few factors, have been applied to evaluate the accumulation or decrease of pre-ribosomal intermediates under mutant conditions. For a global protein-level description of different 60S ribosomal subunit maturation intermediates in yeast, we have adapted a method of in vivo isotopic labelling and mass spectrometry to study pre-60S complexes isolated from strains in which rRNA processing was affected by individual depletion of five factors: Ebp2, Nog1, Nsa2, Nog2 or Pop3. We obtained quantitative data for 45 distinct pre-60S proteins and detected coordinated changes for over 30 pre-60S factors in the analysed mutants. These results led to the characterisation of the composition of early, intermediate and late pre-ribosomal complexes, specific for crucial maturation steps during 60S assembly in eukaryotes."
1529,2008,"6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X is the common receptor determinant recognized by H5, H6, H7 and H9 influenza viruses of terrestrial poultry","BackgroundInfluenza A viruses of domestic birds originate from the natural reservoir in aquatic birds as a result of interspecies transmission and adaptation to new host species. We previously noticed that influenza viruses isolated from distinct orders of aquatic and terrestrial birds may differ in their fine receptor-binding specificity by recognizing the structure of the inner parts of Neu5Acë±2-3Gal-terminated sialyloligosaccharide receptors. To further characterize these differences, we studied receptor-binding properties of a large panel of influenza A viruses from wild aquatic birds, poultry, pigs and horses.ResultsUsing a competitive solid-phase binding assay, we determined viral binding to polymeric conjugates of sialyloligosaccharides differing by the type of Neu5Acë±-Gal linkage and by the structure of the more distant parts of the oligosaccharide chain. Influenza viruses isolated from terrestrial poultry differed from duck viruses by an enhanced binding to sulfated and/or fucosylated Neu5Acë±2-3Gal-containing sialyloligosaccharides. Most of the poultry viruses tested shared a high binding affinity for the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X (Su-SLex). Efficient binding of poultry viruses to Su-SLex was often accompanied by their ability to bind to Neu5Acë±2-6Gal-terminated (human-type) receptors. Such a dual receptor-binding specificity was demonstrated for the North American and Eurasian H7 viruses, H9N2 Eurasian poultry viruses, and H1, H3 and H9 avian-like virus isolates from pigs.ConclusionInfluenza viruses of terrestrial poultry differ from ancestral duck viruses by enhanced binding to sulfated and/or fucosylated Neu5Acë±2-3Gal-terminated receptors and, occasionally, by the ability to bind to Neu5Acë±2-6Gal-terminated (human-type) receptors. These findings suggest that the adaptation to receptors in poultry can enhance the potential of an avian virus for avian-to-human transmission and pandemic spread."
1530,2008,6th International Symposium on Retroviral Nucleocapsid,"Retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons are widespread in all living organisms and, in some instances such as for HIV, can be a serious threat to the human health. The retroviral nucleocapsid is the inner structure of the virus where several hundred nucleocapsid protein (NC) molecules coat the dimeric, genomic RNA. During the past twenty years, NC was found to play multiple roles in the viral life cycle (Fig. 1), notably during the copying of the genomic RNA into the proviral DNA by viral reverse transcriptase and integrase, and is therefore considered to be a prime target for anti-HIV therapy. The 6th NC symposium was held in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on the 20th and 21st of September 2007. All aspects of NC biology, from structure to function and to anti-HIV vaccination, were covered during this meeting."

1532,2008,"A 10-year time-series analysis of respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity in Nicosia, Cyprus: the effect of short-term changes in air pollution and dust storms","Background To date, a substantial body of research has shown adverse health effects of short-term changes in levels of air pollution. Such associations have not been investigated in smaller size cities in the Eastern Mediterranean. A particular feature in the region is dust blown from the Sahara a few times a year resulting in extreme PM10 concentrations. It is not entirely clear whether such natural phenomena pose the same risks.Methods The effect of changes in daily levels of particulate matter (PM10) and ozone (O3) on hospitalization for all, cardiovascular and respiratory causes in the two hospitals in Nicosia during 1 January 1995 and 30 December 2004 was investigated using generalized additive Poisson models after controlling for long- and short-term patterns as well as for the effect of weather. Meteorological records were reviewed to identify dust-storm days and analyses were repeated to quantify their effect on cardio-respiratory morbidity.Results For every 10 ë_g/m3 increase in daily average PM10 concentrations, there was a 0.9% (95%CI: 0.6%, 1.2%) increase in all-cause and 1.2% (95%CI: -0.0%, 2.4%) increase in cardiovascular admissions. With respect to respiratory causes, an effect was observed only in the warm months. No lagged effects with levels of PM10 were observed. In contrast, positive associations with levels of ozone were only observed the two days prior to admission. These appeared stronger for cardiovascular causes and independent of the effect of PM. All-cause and cardiovascular admissions were 4.8% (95%CI: 0.7%, 9.0%) and 10.4% (95%CI: -4.7%, 27.9%) higher on dust storm days respectively. In both cases the magnitude of effect was comparable to that seen on the quartile of non-storm days with the highest levels of PM10.Conclusion We observed an increased risk of hospitalization at elevated levels of particulate matter and ozone generally consistent with the magnitude seen across several European cities. We also observed an increased risk of hospitalization on dust storm days, particularly for cardiovascular causes. While inference from these associations is limited due to the small number of dust storm days in the study period, it would appear imperative to issue health warnings for these natural events, particularly directed towards vulnerable population groups."
1533,2008,A 125 kDa RNase E/G-like protein is present in plastids and is essential for chloroplast development and autotrophic growth in Arabidopsis*,"Endoribonuclease E (RNase E) is a regulator of global gene expression in Escherichia coli and is the best studied member of the RNase E/G ribonuclease family. Homologues are present in other bacteria but the roles of plant RNase E/G-like proteins are not known. Arabidopsis thaliana contains a single nuclear gene (At2g04270) encoding a product with the conserved catalytic domain of RNase E/G-like proteins. At2g04270 and the adjacent At2g04280 gene form converging transcription units with a ‰ö_40 base overlap at their 3‰Ûª ends. Several translation products were predicted from the analyses of At2g04270 cDNAs. An antibody raised against a recombinant A. thaliana RNase E/G-like protein recognized a 125 kDa protein band in purified chloroplast preparations fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The 125 kDa RNase E/G-like protein was detected in cotyledons, rosette and cauline leaves. T-DNA insertions in exon 6 or intron 11 of At2g04270 result in loss of the 125 kDa band or truncation to a 110 kDa band. Loss of At2g04270 function resulted in the arrest of chloroplast development, loss of autotrophic growth, and reduced plastid ribosomal, psbA and rbcL RNA levels. Homozygous mutant plants were pale-green, contained smaller plastids with fewer thylakoids and shorter granal stacks than wild-type chloroplasts, and required sucrose at all growth stages following germination right up to flowering and setting seeds. Recombinant A. thaliana RNase E/G-like proteins rescued an E. coli RNase E mutant and cleaved an rbcL RNA substrate. Expression of At2g04270 was highly correlated with genes encoding plastid polyribonucleotide phosphorylase, S1 RNA-binding, and CRS1/YhbY domain proteins."
1534,2008,"A 12 Week, Open Label, Phase I/IIa Study Using Apatoneå¨ for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer Patients Who Have Failed Standard Therapy","Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral Apatoneå¨ (Vitamin C and Vitamin K3) administration in the treatment of prostate cancer in patients who failed standard therapy.Materials and Methods: Seventeen patients with 2 successive rises in PSA after failure of standard local therapy were treated with (5,000 mg of VC and 50 mg of VK3 each day) for a period of 12 weeks. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling times (PSADT) were calculated before and during treatment at 6 week intervals. Following the initial 12 week trial, 15 of 17 patients opted to continue treatment for an additional period ranging from 6 to 24 months. PSA values were followed for these patients.Results: At the conclusion of the 12 week treatment period, PSAV decreased and PSADT increased in 13 of 17 patients (p ‰ä_ 0.05). There were no dose-limiting adverse effects. Of the 15 patients who continued on Apatone after 12 weeks, only 1 death occurred after 14 months of treatment.Conclusion: Apatone showed promise in delaying biochemical progression in this group of end stage prostate cancer patients."
1535,2008,A 15N stable isotope semen label to detect mating in the malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis Patton,"In previous studies it was determined that the stable isotope 13-carbon can be used as a semen label to detect mating events in the malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis. In this paper we describe the use of an additional stable isotope, 15-nitrogen (15N), for that same purpose. Both stable isotopes can be analysed simultaneously in a mass spectrometer, offering the possibility to detect both labels in one sample in order to study complex and difficult-to-detect mating events, such as multiple mating. 15N-glycine was added to larval rearing water and the target enrichment was 5 atom% 15N. Males from these trays were mated with unlabelled virgin females, and spiked spermathecae were analysed for isotopic composition after mating using mass spectrometry. Results showed that spermathecae positive for semen could be distinguished from uninseminated or control samples using the raw ë«15N‰Û¡ values. The label persisted in spermathecae for up to 5 days after insemination, and males aged 10 days transferred similar amounts of label as males aged 4 days. There were no negative effects of the label on larval survival and male longevity. Enrichment of teneral mosquitoes after emergence was 4.85 å± 0.10 atom% 15N. A threshold value defined as 3 standard deviations above the mean of virgin (i.e. uninseminated spermathecae) samples was successful in classifying a large proportion of samples correctly (i.e. on average 95%). We conclude that alongside 13C, 15N can be used to detect mating in Anopheles and the suitability of both labels is briefly discussed."
1536,2008,A 15-year prospective study of shift work and disability pension,"Objective:To estimate the hazard ratio for disability pension associated with shift work.Methods:Cohorts of shift and day workers were identified in three waves of the Danish Work Environment Cohort Study and followed up for incidence of disability pension in a national register of social transfer payment. A total of 3980 female and 4025 male employees were included in the cohorts. Information about shift work status, age, smoking habits, body mass index and ergonomic work environment were updated according to responses in subsequent waves of the survey when possible. Respondents reporting shift work were classified as shift workers in the following waves as well. Respondents were followed in the register from the time of first interview and were censored at the time of their 60th birthday, emigration, death or end of follow-up (18 June 2006). The authors used the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard ratios for incidence of disability pension and 95% confidence intervals.Results:The authors observed 253 new disability pensions among women and 173 among men during 56‰Ûä903 and 57‰Ûä886 person-years at risk respectively, Among women, shift work predicted disability after adjustment for age, general health and socioeconomic status HR 1.39 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.82). After further adjustment for body mass index, smoking habits, socioeconomic status and ergonomic exposures the association remained statistically significant HR 1.34 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.75). Shift work was not associated with disability among men.Conclusion:Shift work might be moderately associated with disability pension among women; however, more powerful studies are needed to establish the possible association."
1537,2008,"A179L, a viral Bcl-2 homologue, targets the core Bcl-2 apoptotic machinery and its upstream BH3 activators with selective binding restrictions for Bid and Noxa","AbstractSeveral large DNA viruses encode Bcl-2 protein homologues involved in the regulation of the cellular apoptosis cascade. This regulation often involves the interaction of these viral proteins with diverse cellular Bcl-2 family members. We have identified the specific interactions of A179L, an African swine fever virus (ASFV) Bcl-2 homologue, with the active forms of the porcine BH3-only Bid protein (truncated Bid p13 and p15). Transient expression of ASFV A179L gene in Vero cells prevented apoptosis induced by these active forms of Bid protein. Interestingly, A179L protein was able to interact, also with the main core Bcl-2 proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, and with several BH3-only proteins with selective binding restrictions for full length Bid and Noxa. These results suggest a fine regulation for A179L action in the suppression of apoptosis in infected cells which is essential for efficient virus replication."
1538,2008,A 20-year prospective study of mortality and causes of death among hospitalized opioid addicts in Oslo,"BackgroundTo study mortality rate and causes of death among all hospitalized opioid addicts treated for self-poisoning or admitted for voluntary detoxification in Oslo between 1980 and 1981, and to compare their mortality to that of the general population.MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted on 185 opioid addicts from all medical departments in Oslo who were treated for either self-poisoning (n = 93, 1980), voluntary detoxification (n = 75, 1980/1981) or both (n = 17). Their median age was 24 years; with a range from 16 to 41, and 53% were males. All deaths that had occurred by the end of 2000 were identified from the Central Population Register. Causes of death were obtained from Statistics Norway. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed for mortality, in general, and in particular, for different causes of death.ResultsDuring a period of 20 years, 70 opioid addicts died (37.8%), with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) equal to 23.6 (95% CI, 18.7‰ÛÒ29.9). The SMR remained high during the whole period, ranging from 32.4 in the first five-year period, to 13.4 in the last five-year period. There were no significant differences in SMR between self-poisonings and those admitted for voluntarily detoxification. The registered causes of death were accidents (11.4%), suicide (7.1%), cancer (4.3%), cardiovascular disease (2.9%), other violent deaths (2.9%), other diseases (71.4%). Among the 50 deaths classified as other diseases, the category ""drug dependence"" was listed in the vast majority of cases (37 deaths, 52.9% of the total). SMRs increased significantly for all causes of death, with the other diseases group having the highest SMR; 65.8 (95% CI, 49.9‰ÛÒ86.9). The SMR was 5.4 (95% CI, 1.3‰ÛÒ21.5) for cardiovascular diseases, and 4.3 (95% CI, 1.4‰ÛÒ13.5) for cancer. The SMR was 13.2 (95% CI, 6.6‰ÛÒ26.4) for accidents, 10.7 (95% CI, 4.5‰ÛÒ25.8) for suicides, and 28.6 (95% CI, 7.1‰ÛÒ114.4) for other violent deaths.ConclusionThe risk of death among opioid addicts was significantly higher for all causes of death compared with the general population, implying a poor prognosis over a 20-year period for this young patient group."
1539,2008,"A 28,000 Years Old Cro-Magnon mtDNA Sequence Differs from All Potentially Contaminating Modern Sequences","BackgroundDNA sequences from ancient speciments may in fact result from undetected contamination of the ancient specimens by modern DNA, and the problem is particularly challenging in studies of human fossils. Doubts on the authenticity of the available sequences have so far hampered genetic comparisons between anatomically archaic (Neandertal) and early modern (Cro-Magnoid) Europeans.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe typed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region I in a 28,000 years old Cro-Magnoid individual from the Paglicci cave, in Italy (Paglicci 23) and in all the people who had contact with the sample since its discovery in 2003. The Paglicci 23 sequence, determined through the analysis of 152 clones, is the Cambridge reference sequence, and cannot possibly reflect contamination because it differs from all potentially contaminating modern sequences.Conclusions/Significance:The Paglicci 23 individual carried a mtDNA sequence that is still common in Europe, and which radically differs from those of the almost contemporary Neandertals, demonstrating a genealogical continuity across 28,000 years, from Cro-Magnoid to modern Europeans. Because all potential sources of modern DNA contamination are known, the Paglicci 23 sample will offer a unique opportunity to get insight for the first time into the nuclear genes of early modern Europeans."
1540,2008,A2 isoform of mammalian translation factor eEF1A displays increased tyrosine phosphorylation and ability to interact with different signalling molecules,"AbstractThe eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 isoforms of translation elongation factor 1A have 98% similarity and perform the same protein synthesis function catalyzing codon-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to 80S ribosome. However, the isoforms apparently play different non-canonical roles in apoptosis and cancer development which are awaiting further investigations. We hypothesize that the difference in non-translational functions could be caused, in particular, by differential ability of the isoforms to be involved in phosphotyrosine-mediated signalling.The ability of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 to interact with SH2 and SH3 domains of different signalling molecules in vitro was compared. Indeed, contrary to eEF1A1, eEF1A2 was able to interact with SH2 domains of Grb2, RasGAP, Shc and C-terminal part of Shp2 as well as with SH3 domains of Crk, Fgr, Fyn and phospholipase C-gamma1.Interestingly, the interaction of both isoforms with Shp2 in vivo was found using stable cell lines expressing eEF1A1-His or eEF1A2-His. The formation of a complex between endogenous eEF1A and Shp2 was also shown. Importantly, a higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation of eEF1A2 as compared to eEF1A1 was demonstrated in several independent experiments and its importance for interaction of eEF1A2 with Shp2 in vitro was revealed.Thus, despite the fact that both isoforms of eEF1A could be involved in the phosphotyrosine-mediated processes, eEF1A2 apparently has greater potential to participate in such signalling pathways. Since tyrosine kinases/phosphatases play a prominent role in human cancerogenesis, our observations may gave a basis for recently found oncogenicity of the eEF1A2 isoform."
1541,2008,A 38 h interval between hCG priming and oocyte retrieval increases in vivo and in vitro oocyte maturation rate in programmed IVM cycles‰ÛÊ,"BACKGROUNDOur aim was to evaluate whether extending the interval between human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) priming and immature oocyte retrieval increases the oocyte maturation rate following in vitro maturation (IVM).METHODSThis study was performed retrospectively. IVM was performed on 113 polycystic ovary syndrome patients (n = 120 cycles). Oocyte collection was performed either 35 h (Group 1; n = 76) or 38 h (Group 2; n = 44) after 10 000 IU of hCG priming. Following oocyte retrieval, oocyte maturity was assessed and the remaining immature oocytes were cultured in IVM medium up to Day 2.RESULTSThe number of in vivo matured oocytes collected was significantly higher in Group 2 (13.6%, 114/840 versus 7.3%, 96/1312 in Group 1) (P &lt; 0.01); the oocyte maturation rate after Day 1 was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) in Group 2 (46.3 versus 36.0% in Group 1); and clinical pregnancy (40.9 versus 25%) and implantation rates (15.6 versus 9.6%) were better in Group 2 than those in Group 1.CONCLUSIONSThe results suggest that extending the period of hCG priming time from 35 to 38 h for immature oocyte retrieval promotes oocyte maturation in vivo and increases the IVM rate of immature oocytes. Therefore, oocyte retrieval after 38 h of hCG priming may improve subsequent pregnancy outcome in cycles programmed for IVM treatment."

1544,2008,A 5-year-old girl with a congenital ganglioneuroma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy: a case report,"IntroductionGanglioneuroma is a rare, benign, neuroblastic tumor arising mainly from the central or peripheral autonomic nervous system, especially the sympathetic system. The most affected anatomical sites are the posterior mediastinum, retroperitoneum, adrenal gland and head and neck soft tissue. In the current literature, reports of ganglioneuroma diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration and its cytological appearance are scarce.Case PresentationA 5-year-old girl presented with a mass in the cervical region since birth. Laboratory routine tests were within normal limits, ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and well-circumscribed lesion in the soft tissues of the cervical region. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was carried out, and the obtained smears showed a mixture of mature ganglion cells and groups of spindle cells suggestive of schwann cell origin. A diagnosis of ganglioneuroma was suggested. Core biopsy and surgical resection confirmed this diagnosis.ConclusionCongenital ganglioneuroma of the cervical region is an uncommon soft tissue benign neoplasm of neuroblastic origin, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of head and neck pediatric soft tissue tumors. Fine needle aspiration biopsy technique is a reliable method that can be used with confidence when dealing with pediatric soft tissue tumors."
1545,2008,"A 6-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, clinical safety study of lumiracoxib and rofecoxib in osteoarthritis patients","BackgroundLumiracoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) with a superior gastrointestinal (GI) safety profile as compared to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, ibuprofen and naproxen). This safety study compared the GI tolerability, the blood pressure (BP) profile and the incidence of oedema with lumiracoxib and rofecoxib in the treatment of OA. Rofecoxib was withdrawn worldwide due to an associated increased risk of CV events and lumiracoxib has been withdrawn from Australia, Canada, Europe and a few other countries following reports of suspected adverse liver reactions.MethodsThis randomised, double-blind study enrolled 309 patients (aged greater than or equal to 50 years) with primary OA across 51 centres in Europe. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either lumiracoxib 400 mg od (four times the recommended dose in OA) (n = 154) or rofecoxib 25 mg od (n = 155). The study was conducted for 6 weeks and assessments were performed at Weeks 3 and 6. The primary safety measures were the incidence of predefined GI adverse events (AEs) and peripheral oedema. The secondary safety measures included effect of treatment on the mean sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (msSBP and msDBP). Tolerability of lumiracoxib 400 mg was assessed by the incidence of AEs.ResultsLumiracoxib and rofecoxib displayed similar GI safety profiles with no statistically significant difference in predefined GI AEs between the two groups (43.5% vs. 37.4%, respectively). The incidence and severity of individual predefined GI AEs was comparable between the two groups. The incidence of peripheral oedema was low and identical in both the groups (n = 9, 5.8%). Only one patient in the lumiracoxib group and three patients in the rofecoxib group had a moderate or severe event. At Week 6 there was a significantly lower msSBP and msDBP in the lumiracoxib group compared to the rofecoxib group (p &lt; 0.05). A similar percentage of patients in both groups showed an improvement in target joint pain and disease activity. The tolerability profile was similar in both the treatment groups.ConclusionLumiracoxib 400 mg od (four times the recommended dose in OA) provided a comparable GI safety profile to rofecoxib 25 mg od (therapeutic dose). However, lumiracoxib was associated with a significantly better BP profile as compared to rofecoxib.Trial registration number -NCT00637949"
1546,2008,A 6 year Geohelminth infection profile of children at high altitude in Western Nepal,"BackgroundGeohelminth infections are a major problem of children from the developing countries. Children with these infections suffer from developmental impairments and other serious illnesses. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of geohelminth infection, infection intensity as well as the change in the intensity in children from Western Nepal over years.MethodsThis 6-year hospital based prospective study at the Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara included children (&lt; 15 years) visiting the hospital from Kaski and 7 surrounding districts. Samples were also collected from children in the community from different medical camps. Three stool samples from every child were processed using direct and concentration methods. The Kato-Katz technique was used for measuring the intensity of infection.ResultsThe overall prevalence in hospital - attending children was 9.2% with 7.6% in preschool (0 ‰ÛÒ 5 y) and 11.0% in school-age (6 ‰ÛÒ 15 y) children, and in community 17.7% with 14.8% in pre-school and 20.5% in school-age children. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Ancylostoma deodenale and Strongyloides stercoralis were the common geohelminths with a gradual decrease in worm load over the years. School-age children were found to be significantly more prone to geohelminth infection as compared to preschool children, but no statistical difference was detected by gender, district as well as season.ConclusionThis heavy infection of geohelminths in children should be corrected by appropriate medication and maintaining strict personal hygiene. Health education, clean water, good sewage management and a congenial environment should be ensured to minimise infection."
1547,2008,AA-Amyloidosis Can Be Transferred by Peripheral Blood Monocytes,"Spongiform encephalopathies have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion even prior to the clinical onset. Experimental AA-amyloidosis shows similarities with prion disease and amyloid-containing organ-extracts can prime a recipient for the disease. In this systemic form of amyloidosis N-terminal fragments of the acute-phase reactant apolipoprotein serum amyloid A are the main amyloid protein. Initial amyloid deposits appear in the perifollicular region of the spleen, followed by deposits in the liver. We used the established murine model and induced AA-amyloidosis in NMRI mice by intravenous injections of purified amyloid fibrils (‰Û÷amyloid enhancing factor‰Ûª) combined with inflammatory challenge (silver nitrate subcutaneously). Blood plasma and peripheral blood monocytes were isolated, sonicated and re-injected into new recipients followed by an inflammatory challenge during a three week period. When the animals were sacrificed presence of amyloid was analyzed in spleen sections after Congo red staining. Our result shows that some of the peripheral blood monocytes, isolated from animals with detectable amyloid, contained amyloid-seed that primed for AA-amyloid. The seeding material seems to have been phagocytosed by the cells since the AA-precursor (SAA1) was found not be expressed by the monocytes. Plasma recovered from mice with AA amyloidosis lacked seeding capacity. Amyloid enhancing activity can reside in monocytes recovered from mice with AA-amyloidosis and in a prion-like way trigger amyloid formation in conjunction with an inflammatory disorder. Human AA-amyloidosis resembles the murine form and every individual is expected to be exposed to conditions that initiate production of the acute-phase reactant. The monocyte-transfer mechanism should be eligible for the human disease and we point out blood transfusion as a putative route for transfer of amyloidosis."
1548,2008,"AAindex: amino acid index database, progress report 2008","AAindex is a database of numerical indices representing various physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids. We have added a collection of protein contact potentials to the AAindex as a new section. Accordingly AAindex consists of three sections now: AAindex1 for the amino acid index of 20 numerical values, AAindex2 for the amino acid substitution matrix and AAindex3 for the statistical protein contact potentials. All data are derived from published literature.

1549,2008,‰ÛÏAnt‰Û and ‰ÛÏGrasshopper‰Û Life-History Strategies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"From the evolutionary and ecological points of view, it is essential to distinguish between the genetic and environmental components of the variability of life-history traits and of their trade-offs. Among the factors affecting this variability, the resource uptake rate deserves particular attention, because it depends on both the environment and the genetic background of the individuals. In order to unravel the bases of the life-history strategies in yeast, we grew a collection of twelve strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from different industrial and geographical origins in three culture media differing for their glucose content. Using a population dynamics model to fit the change of population size over time, we estimated the intrinsic growth rate (r), the carrying capacity (K), the mean cell size and the glucose consumption rate per cell. The life-history traits, as well as the glucose consumption rate, displayed large genetic and plastic variability and genetic-by-environment interactions. Within each medium, growth rate and carrying capacity were not correlated, but a marked trade-off between these traits was observed over the media, with high K and low r in the glucose rich medium and low K and high r in the other media. The cell size was tightly negatively correlated to carrying capacity in all conditions. The resource consumption rate appeared to be a clear-cut determinant of both the carrying capacity and the cell size in all media, since it accounted for 37% to 84% of the variation of those traits. In a given medium, the strains that consume glucose at high rate have large cell size and low carrying capacity, while the strains that consume glucose at low rate have small cell size but high carrying capacity. These two contrasted behaviors may be metaphorically defined as ‰ÛÏant‰Û and ‰ÛÏgrasshopper‰Û strategies of resource utilization. Interestingly, a strain may be ‰ÛÏant‰Û in one medium and ‰ÛÏgrasshopper‰Û in another. These life-history strategies are discussed with regards to yeast physiology, and in an evolutionary perspective."
1550,2008,AAV-mediated intramuscular delivery of myotubularin corrects the myotubular myopathy phenotype in targeted murine muscle and suggests a function in plasma membrane homeostasis,"Myotubular myopathy (XLMTM, OMIM 310400) is a severe congenital muscular disease due to mutations in the myotubularin gene (MTM1) and characterized by the presence of small myofibers with frequent occurrence of central nuclei. Myotubularin is a ubiquitously expressed phosphoinositide phosphatase with a muscle-specific role in man and mouse that is poorly understood. No specific treatment exists to date for patients with myotubular myopathy. We have constructed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing myotubularin in order to test its therapeutic potential in a XLMTM mouse model. We show that a single intramuscular injection of this vector in symptomatic Mtm1-deficient mice ameliorates the pathological phenotype in the targeted muscle. Myotubularin replacement in mice largely corrects nuclei and mitochondria positioning in myofibers and leads to a strong increase in muscle volume and recovery of the contractile force. In addition, we used this AAV vector to overexpress myotubularin in wild-type skeletal muscle and get insight into its localization and function. We show that a substantial proportion of myotubularin associates with the sarcolemma and I band, including triads. Myotubularin overexpression in muscle induces the accumulation of packed membrane saccules and presence of vacuoles that contain markers of sarcolemma and T-tubules, suggesting that myotubularin is involved in plasma membrane homeostasis of myofibers. This study provides a proof-of-principle that local delivery of an AAV vector expressing myotubularin can improve the motor capacities of XLMTM muscle and represents a novel approach to study myotubularin function in skeletal muscle."
